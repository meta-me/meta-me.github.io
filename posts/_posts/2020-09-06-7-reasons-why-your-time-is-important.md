As life strings us along, it is easy to forget the value of our time. Here are 7 reasons why your time is valuable.

## 1. Time is scarce

Your time is finite and [more limited than you think](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). There isn’t enough time to visit all the places, taste all the foods, or listen to all the music. One could easily spend several lifetimes learning, creating, discovering.  

The world has boundless adventures waiting, but we have so less time. Everything you'll ever do must fit into the time you have left. This makes your time incredibly valuable.

## 2. Time flows constantly

Time constantly flows and doesn't stop for anyone. Whether we sleep or wake, the vast machinery of the universe still goes on. 

As each moment passes, it slips away forever into the past. This makes every moment precious.

## 3. Time left is uncertain

Unexpected events may cut short plans and ambitions. Your life and the lives of those around you can be taken when you least expect it.

Our lives are brief, but no one knows how brief. This makes the time you have now, and the time you can still share with your loved ones so much more valuable.

## 4. Gift from our elders

Think of the immense pain mothers endure to create human life, the effort and resources to raise a child, and the sacrifices of our ancestors so we may enjoy today's freedoms and opportunities.

The world we enjoy each day is a gift built from the blood, sweat and tears of our elders. You represent the dreams and hopes of the people before you. Because of this, your life is immeasurably valuable. By extension, your time is immeasurably valuable.

## 5. Time as a human

Considering the myriad of lifeforms on the [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree), being human is like winning the lottery. We have wonderful physical bodies capable breathing, smelling, tasting, hearing and seeing. We can experience a huge range of emotions such as joy, love, and passion. We have complex brains capable of planning, problem solving and learning. We have the intellect to understand this world, creativity to create masterpieces of art and music, the ability to inspire others.

You have the body and mind of the wisest and most intelligent creature on earth. This has value.

## 6. Potential of every individual

Your time is valuable because you affect the world around you. While many things are outside of our control, there are many things we can control. A smile, a conversation, a kind gesture can have a huge impact on other people’s lives.

We all stand on the shoulders of giants; men and women who have moved societies, nations and humanity. Within all of us is the remarkable ability to dream, transform, and self actualize. Your time is potential energy to mould yourself and the world to your image.

## 7. Great time to be alive

Across the huge span of human history, this is one of the best times to be alive. The internet gives us more information than we could ever consume. Social media and apps lets us communicate and share ideas with people across the globe. We can travel across the globe, experience different cultures, see and appreciate the wonders of the world. Mass production has given us an abundance our ancestors would never have dreamed of. Food, clothing, gadgets, entertainment delivered at the click of a button.

Never before have personal freedoms and individual liberty been so respected by society. Ours is mostly a tolerant and civil society where one can freely express themselves and pursue happiness in the way they want.

We are at the brink of several exciting breakthroughs as a species. Humans will soon be exploring and settling on Mars, making us a multiplanetary species. Genetic engineering and technology like CRISPR may speed up our evolution. General AI and quantum computing may help us unlock more secrets of the universe.

Imagine what our ancestors would have given to see the progress of humanity today. We are living in an incredibly exciting time.

## Summary

Your time is incredibly valuable. It is scarce, continually slipping away and you don’t know when your journey will end. Your life is also incredibly valuable. You are moulded by the resources and time of your family and close ones. You have great capacity to sense, experience and think. Within you is great potential to transform yourself and those around you and you live in the greatest time in human history.

We are all directors of our own life story. Let us all create stories we are proud of.
