title: What's coming to MetaMe in 2021?
---

Big updates are coming to MetaMe in 2021. These include upgrades to MetaMe's data collection engine, export to csv feature and also updates to MetaMe network social features.

## Export feature
Many users have requested an export feature to enable further analysis their usage data in other applications. MetaMe's export feature will allow you to select a date range and granularity (15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day). Exported fields will include application name, group, date, time, duration.

Export to CSV will be available in MetaMe 0.21.0

## MetaMe Network social features
Metame Network is missing some crucial social features like commenting, liking and discovering. These features will give MetaMe users better ability to connect and interact.

These features are planned for mid year release.

## Collection of window title and url data
MetaMe currently does not collect window titles and full URLs. At times this makes it difficult to determine the kind of activity being performed. Watching YouTube may be mostly unproductive, but some videos may be educational and productive. You may also wish to know the exact documents you were working on at a particular time.

Hopefully this feature will be available at the end of the year.

## Feedback welcome
MetaMe is slowly maturing, but there is still much to fix and improve. We love to hear your suggestions and feedback. Please don't hesitate to email us at hello@metameapp.com
