Have you ever wondered what you were doing with your time more than few months ago? A new feature now lets to you view a full years worth of data on the heatmap at any one time.

<img class="my-3 w-100" srcset="
                /assets/full-heatmap-1x.png 1x,
                /assets/full-heatmap-2x.png 2x,
                /assets/full-heatmap-3x.png 3x,
                /assets/full-heatmap-4x.png 4x
              " src="/assets/full-heatmap-1x.png" alt="Full heatmap view"
              title="Full heatmap view" />
