As life strings us along, we tend to forget the value of our time. Here are x reasons why your time is incredibly important

## 1. Time is scarce

<div class="text-right mb-4">
<span class="font-italic">"One of the biggest illusions that we live in is that we have unlimited time. With that mindset, we are uncontrolled to waste it as much as we can."</span> - Neeraj Agnihotri
</div>

Time is incredibly scarce. Our lives are short and our time fleeting.

Everything you'll ever do needs must fit within your lifetime. You also only have one chance to live it.

## 2. Time flows constantly

<div class="text-right mb-4">
<span class="font-italic">"Whether we sleep or wake, the vast machinery of the universe still goes on."</span> - Thomas Paine
</div>

Time doesn't stop for anyone. It cannot be reversed. As each moment passes, it slips away forever into the past.

This makes every moment precious.

## 3. Time left is uncertain

<div class="text-right mb-4">
<span class="font-italic">"Now is the time for you to reflect, not only that all things are mortal, but also that their mortality is subject to no fixed law. Whatever can happen at any time can happen today"</span> - Seneca 
</div>

Human bodies are fragile and vulnerable. Our life and the lives of those around you can be taken in the most unexpected time. The plans and ambitions of mortals can be cut short without any warning.

We know our lives are brief, but no one knows how brief. This makes the time you have now, and the time you can still share with your loved ones so much more valuable.
