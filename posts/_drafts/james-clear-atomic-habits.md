# Chapter 1
Idea: slight improvement everyday leads to massive gains long term. Conversely slight errors replicated compounds to massive errors long term

"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them."
"Habits are the compount interest fo self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better everyday counts for a lot in the long run"

"Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a laggin measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits.  Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your leaning habits.  

" Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. 

Idea: There is plateau at times between outcomes and habits. E.g .Heating ice, it only starts melting when its over 0 degrees

"Plateau of Latent Potential"

"Habits often appear to make no difference untill you cross a critical threhold and unlock a new level of performance"

## Forget about goals, focus on systems
- "Goals are about the results you want to achieve, Systems are about the processes that lead to those results"

Justification: 
If you focused on systems instead of goal, you'll still succeed. 

"Super Bowl Winner Bill Walsh: "The score takes care of itself"

Goals are good for setting a direction but systems are best for making progress

### Problems with spending too much time thiking about your goals instead of systems
1. Winners and Losers have the same goals
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
3. Goals restrict your happiness
   - Creates an either or mentality, "Once I've reached my goal then I'll be happy
   - Falling in love with the process you don't have to give yourself permission to be happy
4. Goals are at odds with long term progress
   - creates a yoyo effect. Once goal is attained motivation is gone.
   - Lots of people revert to old habits after accomplishing a goal
   - True long term thinking is goal-less thinking

## Systems thinking
- "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems"
- Atomic
   - a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement

# Chapter 2 - How your habits shape your identity
Unhealthy habits can feel impossible to break
- Junk food
- procrastinating
- smoking

Why are they hard to change?
1. Changing the wrong thing
2. Changing habits in the wrong way

# Changing the wrong thing
Three levels of behaviour change. Kind of like an onion
1. Identity - Inner most layer 
2. Processes - Middle layer 
3. Outcomes - Outer layer

"Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is what you believe"

Two ways to changing
- Outcome based habits
   - More likely to fail
- Identity based habits
   - More likely to succeed

"Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last"

"The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity"

"The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it."

"True behaviour change is identity change"

"Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are"

"The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it."

# Identity Conflict

"progress required unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity"

Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but its unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.

"Every action you take a vote for the type of person you wish to become"

"Habits are the path to changing your identity"

How to forge a new identity
1. Decide the type of person you want to be
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins

## Feedback loops
" Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits"

"The first step is not what or how, but who" You need to know who you want to be."

"You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment."

"Habits can help you achieve all these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone."

## Summary
"The most effective way to change your habits is focus not on what you want to achieve but who you wish to become"

"Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote fo the type of person you wish to become."

# Chapter 3 - How to build better habits in 4 simple steps

Thorndike on learning;
"Behaviour followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated"

"As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases"

"Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience"

"When you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. "Building habits int he present allows you to do more of what you want in the future"

4 steps to habits 
1. Cue
   - Noticing a rewards
2. Craving
   - motivation or desire 
3. Response
   - Actual habit you perform, either a thought or an action
   - Action depends on friction
      - Mental energy
      - Physical energy
4. Reward
   - End goal of the habit

## Purpose of rewards
1. Satisfy us
2. Teach us

## Four laws of behaviour Change

Creating good habits
Law 1 (cue) - Make it obvious
Law 2 (craving) - Make it attractive
Law 3 (response) - Make it easy
Law 4 (Reward) = Make it satisfying

Breaking bad habits
Law 1 (cue) - Make it invisible
Law 2 (craving) - Make it unattractive
Law 3 (Response) - Make it difficult
Law 4 (Reward) = Make it unsatisfying

## Summary
"Habit is a behaviour that has been repeated enough times to bbecome automatic"


# Chapter 4 - Make it obvious

"With enough practice you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it."

"If a habit remains mindless you can't expect to improve it."

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate"
- Carl Jung

## Habit scorecard

"Pointing and Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level."

"Many of our failures in performance are largely attribguted to a lack of self-awareness"

"One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing."

Suggestion: List out all your activities from the beginning of the day
- Exercise 1. Ask whether the habit is good, bad or neutral
- Exercise 2. Ask whether the habit will benefit you in the long run

"Observe your thoughts and actions without judgement or internal criticism. Don't blame yourself for your faults, or praise yourself for your success"

## Summary
"The process of behaviour change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them"

# Chapter 5 - The best way to start a new habit
Implementation intention - 
- Plan you make about when and where to act
- Increased rate of adherance significantly
- Hundreds of studies shown that implementation intentions are effective

Fill out the foloowing sentence:
I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]

"Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity"

Start first day of month, hope is higher

Diderot effect - Obtaining a new possession ofter creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases

Habit Stacking
- Place one habit after another

Suggestions
- Make cues that are highly specific
- Make actions immediately actionable

## Summary
- The 1st Law of Behaviour Change is make it obvious
- "The two most common cues are time and location"

# Chapter 6 - Motivation is overrated, environment matters more
Thorndike on "choice architecture"

People often choose products not because of what they are, but because f where they are.

Kurt Lewin - Behaviour is a function fo the Person in their Environment, or B = f(P,E)

"The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it."

"Vision is the greatest catalyst of our behaviour"

## Designing environment for success
E.g. Dutch researchers noticed that househoulds more aware of their electrical meter used 30% less energy 

Redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious

"Habits can be easier to change in a new environment"
- "It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues"

"Every habit should have a home"

## Summary
"Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behaviour over time"
"Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out"

# Chapter 7 - Secret to self control
E.g. addictions can be resolved more easily with a change in environment. Heroin addicts in vietnam after returning home only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years.

Disciplined people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.

"If you can't seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours"

"If you're continually feeling like your not enough stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy"

For bad behaviours make it invisible

"Self-control is a short term strategy, not a long term one."

"You may be able to resist tempatation once or twice, but its unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time.

## Summary 
- "People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it."
- "One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it"
"Self-control is a short term strategy, not a long term one."

# Chapter 8 - How to make a habit irresistable

## Dopamine driven feedback loop
- You can measure the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring dopamine
- Mice with no dopamine lost the will to live, they wouldn't eat, sex, didn't crave anything
- Pleasure remained, but didn't want it anymore

"Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it"

Temptation Bundling
- linking an action you want with an action you need to do

Premack's Principle
"More probable behaviours will reinforce less probable behaviours"

# Chapter 9 - The role of family and friends in shaping your habits

## The seductive pull of social norms

"We don't choose our earliest habits, we imitate them"

"The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along" - Michel de Montaigne

- Imitation happens from three groups in particular
1. The close
2. The many
3. The powerful

"The closer we are to someone the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits"

"We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us"

"Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe"

## Imitating the many

Chimps would use a less effective nut cracking strategy to blend in with the rest of the chimps

Reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart or finding truth

## Imitating the powerful
Once we fit in we start to look for ways to stand out

We imitate the people we envy

## Summary
- We tend to adpt habits that are praised and approved by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups, the close, the many and the powerful
- Normal behaviour of the tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of the individual
   - We would rather be wrong with the crowd than right by ourselves

# Chapter 10 - How to find and fix the causes of your bad habits

Use mental tricks to make bad habits unattractive
- Reason them out

"Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you'll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature

When you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment

"every action is preceded by a prediction"

cue > prediction > feeling/urge/craving

"When you binge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel different"

"Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your midn and make a habit seem more attractive"

Pregame rituals may help with motivation and focus

The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that preceds them. The prediction leads to a feeling

# Chapter 11 - Walk slowly but never backward

"The best is the enemy of the good" - Voltaire

Motion - planning and strategizing and learning 
   - Don't produce any result

Action - is the type of behaviour that will deliver an outcome

"If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition not perfection"

Automaticity

## Summary
- The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning
- Focus on taking action not being in motion
- The amount of time you ahve been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it

# Chapter 12 - Law of least effort
"Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible"

"It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate towards the option that requires the least amount of work.

"The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible."

## Prime the environment for future use
If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, lay out any plates and utensils you'll need the night before. When you wake up making breakfast will be easy"

Increase friction of bad habits

## Summary
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier



# Chapter 13 How to stop procrastinating by using the two-minute rule

"A habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward"

## Two minute rule
"When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do"

What you want is a "gateway habit" that naturally leads you down a more productive path

"The point is to master the habit of showing up"

"a habit must be established before it can improve"

"The best way is to always stop when you are going good" - Hemingway

## Summary
- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behaviour for minutes or hours afterward.

- The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things

- Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist

# Chapter 14 How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

Story
- Victor Hugo once locked all his clothes except for a large shawl away to achieve a deadline
   - The Hunchback of Notre Dame was released two weeks early as a result

Commitment device
- Choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future
- E.g.
   - Ban list
   - locking phone away

"Change a task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.

"Its easy to write off these minor distractions as "just taking a break" but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue."

Time management strategy
- Get a friend to change all passwords on all social media accounts 
- Friday submit the passwords back

## Summary
- The ultimate way to lock in future behaviour is to auomate your habits

# Chapter 15- Make it satisfying

Cardinal Rule of Behaviour change - What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.

"We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction"

Time inconsistency
- The way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.

"The consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate"

"It almost always happens that when the immediate consequences is favourable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa... Often the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits" - Bastiat

"As a general rule, the more immediate the pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals

"Select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity, rather than conflict with it"

# Chapter 16 - How to stick with Good Habits everyday

Paperclip strategy
  - Make a call then move a paperclip from one jar to another

"Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures - like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles - provide clear evidence of your progress"

"As a result they reinforce your behaviour and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity."

"Don't break the chain"

## Benefits of Habit tracking
1. Habit tracking is obvious
- Recording your last action creates a trigger than can initiate next one.

"Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don't"

"The mere act of tracking a behaviour can spark the urge to change it"

"Habit tracking also keeps you honest."

"Most of us have a distored view of our own behaviour."

"We think we act better than we do"

"Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behaviour and notice what's really going on each day"

2. Habit tracking is attractive

The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward we become more motivated to continue down that path"

3. Habit tracking is satisfying
It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list
- Habit tracking also keeps your eye on the ball: you're focused on the process rather than the result

## How to recover quickly when your habits break down
- Never miss twice

## Knowing when to track and not track a habit

Goodhart's Law
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

## Summary
"One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress"
"Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress"

# Chapter 17 - How an Accountability partner can change everything

"The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behaviour."

"the strength of the punishment must match the strength of the behaviour it is trying to correct"

"Create a habit contract"
A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you"

## Summary
- Make bad habits unstaisfying
- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying
- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us

# Chapter 18 - The Truth about Talent

"Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities"

"You want to play a game where the odds are in your favor"

"Our environment determines the ability of our genes and utility of our natural talents. When our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine success."


Big 5 personality traits

2. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous
3. Extroversion: Outoing and enertic to solitary and reserved
4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached
5. Neuroticism: ansious and sensitive to confident, calm and stable


## How to find the game where the odds are in your favour

Questions
- What feels like fun to me, but work for others? 
- What makes me lose track of time?
- Where do I get greater returns than the average person?
- What comes naturally to me?

# Chapter 19 - The goldilocks rule
The human brain loves a challenge, but only if its within an optimal zone of difficulty

How to stay focused when you get bored working on your goals

"The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredm."

"Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly" - Machiavelli

Psychology this is known as variable reward

"Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way"

"Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going when work isn't exciting that makes the difference"

# Chapter 20 - Downside of creating good habits
"Habits create the foundation for mastery'

"The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors"

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

Establish a system for reflection and review

"Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakesand helps you consider possible paths for improvement.

## Annual Review
1. What went well this year?
2. What didn't go so well this year?
3. What did I learn?

## Integrity Report
1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?
2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?
3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?

"Never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror"

## How to break the beliefs that hold you back?

"Keep your identity small" - Paul Graham

"habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting"

"A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote"

## Summary
"The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it"


# Conclusion

"Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine"
