title: MetaMe 2019 in Review
---
2019 was a busy year for MetaMe. We launched to the public, received much feedback, and made many upgrades to the software.

Some key milestones from 2019:

- Launched to the public with close to 200 downloads.

- Introduced goals, allowing you to easily set and monitor your productivity goal throughout the day.

- Introduced history lookback, allowing you to view previous days by clicking the heatmap. This greatly improves your ability to review your day or week.   

- Improved existing charts with increased granularity and improved tooltips, allowing you to understand your day in more detail. 

- Major stability and performance improvements with many bugs and performance issues of previous versions fixed.

In 2020, we're continuing our mission of making it easy to track and analyze your time in a secure manner. Daily notes, additional themes and more powerful analytics are just some of the features in the pipeline.

Join us in tracking and analyzing your time today.
