# What is SDT? 

Goal
- A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve

Motivation
- What moves someone to action

Regulation
- adjust by rule, control

- Understand where your motivations are along the autonomous-control continuum
- Externally regulated?
   - By force
   - By shame, ego, self-esteem?
   - Advice
       - 
- Identified regulation
   - Need further internalization of the extrinsic motivation
   - promote competence
   - promote autonomy
   - promote relatedness

- Integrated regulation
   - You won't be here if you had this

- Intrinsic motivation
   - Addressed by CET
   - Motivational crowding theory
      - Sometimes offering extrinsic motivations to tasks may reduce intrinsic motivation
   - Influences
      - Rewards
         - positive feedback - +ve
      - interpersonal controls
      - ego-involvements
         - not the best
      - autonomy
      - competence
      - informational feedback
      - relatedness
         - caring and support
            - Grolnick and Ryan[20] found lower intrinsic motivation in children who believed their teachers to be uncaring or cold and so not fulfilling their relatedness needs. 

- Extrinsic motivation & Organismic Integration Theory
   - The more internalized the extrinsic motivation, the more autonomous the person will be when enacting the behaviors.
   - OIT particularly highlights supports for autonomy and relatedness as critical to internalization.
   - concepts
      - continuum of internalization
      - If an external context allows a person to integrate regulation—they must feel competent, related and autonomous. They must also understand the regulation in terms of their other goals to facilitate a sense of autonomy.[25]
      - conflicts between identification
         - Integration is very important because there is potential for conflict among different identifications (e.g., an identification with one’s job and an identification with one’s family), so people need to bring them into coherence.
   
      - Security and caring positive for internalization
         - Ryan, Stiller and Lynch[23] found that children internalize school's extrinsic regulations when they feel secure and cared for by parents and teachers. 
      - Competence facilitates internalization
         - Internalisation of extrinsic motivation is also linked to competence. OIT suggests that feelings of competence in activities should facilitate internalisation of said actions.[24]
      - Meaningful rationales
         - This was supported by Deci, Eghrari, Patrick and Leone[26] who found in laboratory settings if a person was given a meaningful reason for uninteresting behaviour along with support for their sense of autonomy and relatedness they internalized and integrated their behaviour. 
   - Identified regulation
      - Need further internalization of the extrinsic motivation
      - promote competence
      - promote autonomy
      - promote relatedness

   - Integrated regulation
      - Occurring when regulations are fully assimilated with self so they are included in a person's self evaluations and beliefs on personal needs
      - You won't be here if you had this



# Psychological hacking
Organismic Viewpoint
-  Organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of self. However societal forces may support or thwart this

## What is intrinsic motivation?
Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity for its own sake because it is interesting and satisfying in itself, as opposed to doing an activity to obtain an external goal (extrinsic motivation)

## What is internalization? 
Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioural regulations that were originally external

# Basic Theory
SDT is centered on the belief that human nature shows persistent positive features, that it repeatedly shows effort, agency and commitment in their lives that the theory calls "inherent growth tendencies".
Three essential elements
1. Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and mastering their inner forces (such as drives and emotions)
2. Humans have an inherent tendency toward growth development and integrated functioning
3. Optimal development and actions are inherent in humans but they don't happen automatically 

# 6 mini theories
## Cognitive Evaluation Theory
- concerns intrinsic motivation, motivation that is based on the satisfactions of behaving “for its own sake.”  
- Eg. Child’s exploration and play
- CET specifically addresses the effects of social contexts on intrinsic motivation, or how factors such as rewards, interpersonal controls, and ego-involvements impact intrinsic motivation and interest
- CET highlights the critical roles played by competence and autonomy supports in fostering intrinsic motivation, which is critical in education, arts, sport, and many other domains.
- Explains the phenomenon of "Motivation crowding theory"
- Claiming social context events like feedback on work or rewards lead to feelings of competence and so enhance intrinsic motivations
- "CET and intrinsic motivation is also linked to relatedness through the hypothesis that intrinsic motivation flourishes if linked with a sense of security and relatedness"
   - Grolnick and Ryan[20] found lower intrinsic motivation in children who believed their teachers to be uncaring or cold and so not fulfilling their relatedness needs. 

### Motivation crowding theory
   - Sometimes offering extrinsic motivations to tasks may reduce intrinsic motivation

## Organismic Integration Theory (OIT)
- addresses the topic of extrinsic motivation in its various forms, with their properties, determinants, and consequences
- Yet, there are distinct forms of instrumentality, which include external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration
- The more internalized the extrinsic motivation, the more autonomous the person will be when enacting the behaviors.
- These subtypes of extrinsic motivation are seen as falling along a continuum of internalization
- OIT particularly highlights supports for autonomy and relatedness as critical to internalization.
- OIT proposes internalization is more likely to occur when there is a sense of relatedness. 
- If an external context allows a person to integrate regulation—they must feel competent, related and autonomous. They must also understand the regulation in terms of their other goals to facilitate a sense of autonomy.[25]

### Amotivation
Not motivated at all

### Externally regulated 
Complete external locus of control. If external regulation stops behaviour stops.  Thus, external regulation is the least auton-
omous and most controlled form of extrinsic motivation.

### introjection
This is the kind of behaviour where people feel motivated to demonstrate ability to maintain self-worth. Since the causality of the behavior is perceived as external, the behavior is considered non-self-determined.
"Introjection includes being motivated by contingent self-esteem, guilt, or ego-involvement."
- involves people being focused on approval versus disapproval in their
jobs and from their leaders, as well as a concern with status and recognition

### Identification
It involves consciously valuing a goal or regulation so that said action is accepted as personally important.
" involves
people identifying with the personal value and importance of
the behavior for themselves and thus accepting it as their own."
- "Still more autonomous is identified regulation, in which the individuals have personally identified with
the importance or value of their work roles and behaviors"

### Integration
- most autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation
- Occurring when regulations are fully assimilated with self so they are included in a person's self evaluations and beliefs on personal needs
- integrated motivations share qualities with intrinsic motivation but are still classified as extrinsic because the goals that are trying to be achieved are for reasons extrinsic to the self
- rather than the inherent enjoyment or interest in the task.

"Finally, the fullest type of inter-
nalized extrinsic motivation is labeled integrated regulation. It
involves people having integrated new identifications with
other aspects of their own integrated sense of self – that is, with
other identifications, values, and needs"

Finally,when people assimilate and integrate
their identifications, they can act through integrated regulation, which is the most mature and
volitional form of extrinsic motivation

"When identifications have been
integrated, people are wholeheartedly engaged and purposive with respect to the target activities,
and without inner barriers or conflicts."

### Conflicts
 Integration is very important because there is potential for
conflict among different identifications (e.g., an identification with one’s job and an identification with one’s family), so people need to bring them into coherence.

 When identifications have been
integrated, people are wholeheartedly engaged and purposive with respect to the target activities,
and without inner barriers or conflicts.

### Examples
- Ryan, Stiller and Lynch[23] found that children internalize school's extrinsic regulations when they feel secure and cared for by parents and teachers. 
- Internalisation of extrinsic motivation is also linked to competence. OIT suggests that feelings of competence in activities should facilitate internalisation of said actions.[24]
- This was supported by Deci, Eghrari, Patrick and Leone[26] who found in laboratory settings if a person was given a meaningful reason for uninteresting behaviour along with support for their sense of autonomy and relatedness they internalized and integrated their behaviour. 

## Causality Orientations Theory (COT)
- Differences in individual reactions
- describes individual differences in people’s tendencies to orient toward environments and regulate behavior in various ways
1. the autonomy orientation in which persons act out of interest in and valuing of what is occurring;
2. the control orientation in which the focus is on rewards, gains, and approval; 
3. impersonal or amotivated orientation characterized by anxiety concerning competence.

## Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT)
- These needs are seen as universal necessities that are innate, not learned (instinctive), and seen in humanity across time, gender and culture
- BPNT argues that psychological well-being and optimal functioning is predicated on autonomy, competence, and relatedness
- three needs
   - Autonomy
      -  or self-determinatio
   - Competance
      - Or effectance
   - Relatedness
      - Or belongingness

- Therefore, contexts that support versus thwart these needs should invariantly impact wellness. 
- The theory argues that all three needs are essential and that if any is thwarted there will be distinct functional costs

### Examples
1. Autonomy Examples
- Research by Amabile, DeJong and Lepper[28] found other external factors like deadlines, which restrict and control, also decrease intrinsic motivation. 
- Deci[27] found that offering people extrinsic rewards for behaviour that is intrinsically motivated undermined the intrinsic motivation as they grow less interested in it. Initially intrinsically motivated behaviour becomes controlled by external rewards, which undermines their autonomy. 
- Situations that give autonomy as opposed to taking it away also have a similar link to motivation. Studies looking at choice have found that increasing a participant's options and choices increases their intrinsic motivation.[29]
2. Competence Examples
- Deci[27] found that giving people unexpected positive feedback on a task increases people's intrinsic motivation to do it, meaning that this was because the positive feedback was fulfilling people's need for competence
In fact, giving positive feedback on a task served only to increase people's intrinsic motivation and decreased extrinsic motivation for the task. 
- Vallerand and Reid[18] found negative feedback has the opposite effect (i.e., decreasing intrinsic motivation by taking away from people's need for competence). 
3. Relatedness Examples
Frodi, Bridges and Grolnick[30]
- "A comparison of the secure/stable and the insecure/stable groups, however, did suggest that the secure/stable group was superior to the insecure/stable groups on all mastery-related measures

## Goal Contents Theory (GCT)
- There are individual differences in the needs of individuals
- grows out of the distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic goals and their impact on motivation and wellness.
- Extrinsic goals such as financial success, appearance, and popularity/fame have been specifically contrasted with intrinsic goals such as community, close relationships, and personal growth, with the former more likely associated with lower wellness and greater ill-being.
- Three orientations
   - Autonomous Orientations: result from satisfaction of the basic needs
   - Strong controlled orientations: Result from satisfaction of competence and relatedness needs but not of autonomy and is linked to regulation through internal and external contingencies, which lead to rigid functioning and diminished well being.
   - Impersonal Orientations: Results from failing to fulfill all three needs. This is also related to poor functioning and ill being.

### Life Goals
- Life goals are long-term goals people use to guide their activities, and they fall into two categories:[31]
   - Intrinsic Aspirations: Contain life goals like affiliation, generativity and personal development.
   - Extrinsic Aspirations: Have life goals like wealth, fame and attractiveness.
- There have been several studies on this subject that chart intrinsic goals being associated with greater health, well being and performance.[32]

### Questions
1. Is there a competence and autonomy orientation, with low relatedness
2. Is there a autonomy and relatedness orientation with no competence 

## Relationships Motivation Theory (RMT)
- Relatedness, which has to do with the development and maintenance of close personal relationships such as best friends and romantic partners as well as belonging to groups, is one of the three basic psychological needs.
- However, research shows that not only is the relatedness need satisfied in high-quality relationships, but the autonomy need and to a lesser degree the competence need are also satisfied

# Experiments
### Deci 1971 Experiment 1
This experiment tested the hypothesis that if an individual is intrinsically motivated to perform an activity, introduction of an extrinsic reward decreases the degree of intrinsic motivation to perform the task. 
- 24 students (12 control, 12 experimental)
- 3 sessions over 3 days
- Activity was Soma cube puzzle
- In each session, the participants were shown four different configurations drawn on a piece of paper and were asked to use the puzzle to reproduce the configurations while they were being timed. 

- The first and third session of the experimental condition were identical to control, but in the second session the participants in the experimental condition were given a dollar for completing each puzzle within time. 
   - During the middle of each session, the experimenter left the room for eight minutes and the participants were told that they were free to do whatever they wanted during that time, while the experimenter observed during that period. 
   - The amount of time spent working on the puzzle during the free choice period was used to measure motivation.

#### Results
- After extrinsic reward offered, motivation increased for session 2 as expected. However in session 3 of the experimental group, intrinsic motivation dropped lower than in the first session
- All subjects reported finding the task interesting and enjoyable at the end of each session, providing evidence for the experimenter's assumption that the task was intrinsically motivating for the college students.
- The study showed some support of the experimenter's hypothesis and a trend towards decrease in intrinsic motivation was seen after money was provided to the participants as external reward. 

### Deci 1971 Experiement 2
- Design similar to Experiment 1
- college biweekly newspaper
- 4 student workers for control and 4 experimental
- The control and experimental group students were not aware that they were being observed.
- The 10-week observation was divided into three time periods. 
- The task in this study required the students to write headlines for the newspaper. 
- During "Time 2", the students in the experimental group were given 50 cents for each headline they wrote. At the end of Time 2, they were told that in the future the newspaper cannot pay them 50 cent for each headline anymore as the newspaper ran out of the money allocated for that and they were not paid for the headlines during Time 3. 
- The speed of task completion (headlines) was used as a measure of motivation in this experiment. Absences were used as a measure of attitudes. 
- To assess the stability of the observed effect, the experimenter observed the students again (Time 4) for two weeks.

#### Results
The results of this experiment were similar to Experiment I and monetary reward was found to decrease the intrinsic motivation of the students, supporting Deci's hypothesis. 

### Deci 1971 Experiment 3
- Similar to Experiment 1
- Verbal praise used as extrinsic reward 
- Hypothesis
   - The experimenter hypothesized that a different type of reward—i.e., social approval in the form of verbal reinforcement and positive feedback for performing the task that a person is intrinsically motivated to perform—enhances the degree of external motivation, even after the extrinsic reward is removed.
#### Results
The results of the experiment III confirmed the hypothesis and the students' performance increased significantly during the third session in comparison to session one, showing that verbal praise and positive feedback enhances performance in tasks that a person is initially intrinsically motivated to perform. This provides evidence that verbal praise as external reward increases intrinsic motivation. 

### Pritchard, Campbell and Campbell (1977)
- Similar but with Chess puzzles
- Time spent during free period was again used as a measure of intrinsic motivations

### Discussion of results
When a person is intrinsically motivated to perform a task and money is introduced to work on the task, the individual cognitively re-evaluates the importance of the task and the intrinsic motivation to perform the task (because the individual finds it interesting) shifts to extrinsic motivation and the primary focus changes from enjoying the task to gaining financial reward.
- However, when verbal praise is provided in a similar situation increases intrinsic motivation as it is not evaluated to be controlled by external factors and the person sees the task as an enjoyable task that is performed autonomously. The increase in intrinsic motivation is explained by positive reinforcement and an increase in perceived locus of control to perform the task. 

### Murcia, Roman, Galindo, Alonso and Gonzalez-Cutre
- Data analysis revealed that when peers are supportive and there is an emphasis on cooperation, effort, and personal improvement, the climate influences variables like basic psychological needs, motivation and enjoyment.

# Other
- For example, SDT research has focused on the role of mindfulness as a foundation for autonomous regulation of behavior, leading to both refined measurement and theorizing about awareness.
- Research on wellness has also led to new theory and research on the assessment of well-being itself, including the distinction between hedonic and eudaimonic forms of living.

# Awareness
has always been associated with autonomous functioning; however, it was only recently that the SDT researchers incorporated the idea of mindfulness and its relationship with autonomous functioning and emotional wellbeing in their research. 

## Brown and Ryan
conducted a series of five experiments to study mindfulness
- From their experiments, the authors concluded that when individuals act mindfully, their actions are consistent with their values and interest. 
- possibility that being autonomous and performing an action because it is enjoyable to oneself increases mindful attention to one's actions. 

# Vitality
Ryan and Deci[44] define vitality as energy available to the self, either directly or indirectly, from basic psychological needs. This energy allows individuals to act autonomously. 
Many theorists have posited that self-regulation depletes energy but SDT researchers have proposed and demonstrated that only controlled regulation depletes energy, autonomous regulation can actually be vitalizing.[45]

Ryan, Bernstein, and Brown[46] used SDT to explain the effect of weekends on the well-being of adult working population. The study[46] determined that people felt higher well-being on weekends due to greater feelings of autonomy, and feeling closer to others (relatedness), in weekend activities.

# Providing Rationales
- Hyungshim Jang
- Undergraduate students (N = 136; 108 women, 28 men) worked on a relatively uninteresting short lesson after either receiving or not receiving a rationale. Students who received the rationale showed greater interest, work ethic, and determination. 
- Models
    1. An identified regulation model based on self-determination theory
    2. An interest regulation model based on interest-enhancing strategies research
    3. An additive model that integrated both models.

# Sudbury schools
- K-12 school where students decide what they want to learn. Teachers play an assistant role. students have complete responsibility for their own education

# Alcoholism
 For instance, in a study conducted by Knee and Neighbors,[50] external factors in the individuals who claim to not be motivated by internal factors were found to be associated with drinking for extrinsic reasons, and with stronger perceptions of peer pressure, which in turn was related to heavier alcohol use.
 - Further, it may be hypothesized that the relationship between self-determination and drinking may be mediated to some extent by the perceived approval of others


# Motivational Interviewing
- Technique for changing behaviour
- Used initially in the area of addiction (Miller & Rollnick, 2002)
- It is a client-centered method that doesn't persuade or coerce patients to change and instead attempts to explore and resolve their ambivalent feelings, which allows them to choose themselves whether to change or not.

- Markland, Ryan, Tobin, and Rollnick[53] believe that SDT provides a framework behind how and the reasons why MI works
- They believe that MI provides an autonomy-supportive atmosphere, which allows clients to find their own source of motivation and achieve their own success (in terms of overcoming addiction)

# Environment behaviours
- Self-determination theory suggests that motivation can predict behavior performance.
- Pelletier et al. (1999) shows that four personal beliefs, helplessness, strategy, capacity, and effort, lead to greater amotivation, while self-determination has an inverse relationship with amotivation

# Intervention strategies
- Monetary incentives, persuasive communication, and convenience are often successful in the short term, but when the intervention is removed, behavior is discontinued. In the long run, such intervention strategies are therefore expensive and difficult to maintain.[55]
- The results suggested that people with higher degree of self-perceived autonomy successfully perform behaviors and are more likely to do so in the long term.[60]
- Based on the connection between self-determination theory and environmental behaviors, Pelletier et al. suggest that successful intervention should emphasize self-determined motivation for performing environmental behaviors.[56]

VALLERAND (2000) - Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory

# Vallerand
Hierarchical model of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation
- Global Level (Personality level)
- Contextual Level (Life domain)
   - Education, Interpersonal Relationships, Leisure
- Situational Level (State)

## Effects
### Top Down effect
- Global level afects contextual level, and contextual level affects situational level

- Eg. contextual motivation towards an activity predicted situational motivation towards the activity 3 months later

### Bottom up effect
- Recursive effect
- Negative feedback loops
   - Low levels of intrinsic motivation in the classroom at situational level leads to lower levels ofm intrinsic motivation at the contextual level  
- Eg. contextual motivation after a tournament was affected by situational motivation of the tournament itself

### Tradeoffs
- Loss in self-determined motivation in one context (education) can lead a person to compensate in an other context (leisure)
- Hypothesis
   - Individuals work to restore their global motivation at a certain level.
- Study
   - Someone who did poorly in exam might compensate in another domain such as sport
   - "Losses in competence and self-determined motivation in one domain (school) seem to have motivated individuals to restore the sense of self, and consequently, to experience an increase in self-determined motivation toward the other context (sport).

- SDT, loss in self-determined motivation is replaced by less optimal ways of functional (external regulation, amotivation, etc)

- Whether three needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness are innate and universal is up for discussion

## Role of Psychological Needs in the Motivational Sequence
- Is need satisfaction a direct contributor of psychological outcomes or is it the motivation itself?
- Unclear causal sequence in Deci and Ryan
- Hierarchical model causal sequence
   - the environment > perceived autonomy, competence and relatedness -> motivation - > outcomes
   - 
### The STudy (Grouzet et al. 2000, Study 1)
- hidden word game
- randomly assigned success of failure
- Perceptions of competence and autonomy, situational motivation, positive emotions, outcomes, recorded

Study 2
- randomly assigned to choice or no choice
- 

## Individual Differences in Psychologicalneeds
- Richer, Blanchard and Vallerand (2000) study
- The following were measured from a workplace
   - self-determinedmotivation
   - perceptions of competence
   - perceptions of relatedness towards work
   - "need for relatedness scale" was developed and also recorded

- Hypothesis
   - Perceptions of relatedness stronger mediating effect for those who need relatedness
   - Perceptions of competence stronger for those with less relatedness need

## Different Roles of the Need for Relatedness
- Deci and Ryan
   - "role of relatedness is more distal"

- Hypothesis
   - Role of relatedness depends on the context
      - Academic, this is less important
      - Team sports, relatedness is much more important
   - Relatedness can play a major role in determining motivation, depending on the context

- Relatedness as value transmission
- "Value transmission refers to the beliefs and values held by certain individuals and groups that eventually become internalized by other individuals."


# Self-Determination Theory - Deci and Ryan 2015
"Self-determination Theory (SDT) is a motivational theory of personality, development, and social processes that examines
how social contexts and individual differences facilitate different types of motivation, especially autonomous motivation and
controlled motivation, and in turn predict learning, performance, experience, and psychological health"

" SDT proposes that all human beings have three basic psychological needs – the needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness – the satisfaction of which are essential nutrients for effective functioning and wellness"

"As a motivational theory, it addresses what energizes people’s behavior and
moves them into action, as well as how their behavior is
regulated in the various domains of their lives"

# Two types of motivation
autonomous motivation
"When people are autonomously motivated, they act with
a full sense of willingness and volition, wholly endorsing that
which they are doing because they find it either interesting and
enjoyable, or consistent with their deeply held, integrated
values"

# controlled motivation
"In contrast, when people’s motivation is controlled, they act out
of coercion, seduction, or obligation. They tend to experience
pressure and compulsion, rather than concurrence and choice."

## Mechanistic to organismic
Mechanistic - assume that humans are passive and thus require some force
operating on them to move them into action. Eg. Mechanistic is operant behaviour (Skinner,1971)
## Organismic - SDT
assume that humans are by nature active organisms who can
motivate themselves to act on their environment and elaborate
and strengthen their understanding and behavioral repertoire. Eg Piaget (1971)

"Self-determination theory (SDT) is decidedly organismic at
its core. It assumes that humans are active, working to integrate
new material into their own sense of self, but also, and
importantly, that the environment can either provide nutrients
for this integrative process, or can disrupt and impair the
process"

# Autonomous motivation
- intrinsic motivation
- They simply do those
behaviors and this intrinsic motivation is the prototype of
autonomous motivation.
- integrated
- identified


# Controled motivation
- introjected
- externally regulated

"The latter type of motivation involves
a contingency between the target behavior and some separable
consequence desired by the individual. What are referred to as
reinforcers in operant theory can be thought of as extrinsic
motivators"
"People are often extrinsically motivated by the
pursuit of rewards such as money or prizes, the avoidance of
noxious stimuli, or the desire for social approval. Colloquially,
the classic extrinsic motivators are the ‘carrot and stick.’"

# SDT Controversies
People who did an interesting activity to get a monetary reward were
subsequently less intrinsically motivated than others who did
the same activity without getting the reward. This was a very
controversial finding because it highlighted negative effects of
rewards, which is no doubt the archetype of motivation in most
people’s minds, and of course in the behavioral psychologies.

 On the other hand,
the research and meta-analysis also showed that positive
feedback enhanced intrinsic motivation.

Additional experi-
ments showed, as summarized by Ryan and Deci (2000a), that
threats of punishment, deadlines, evaluations, and surveillance
all undermined intrinsic motivation, whereas providing people
with choice, as well as acknowledging their feelings and
perspectives, tended to enhance their intrinsic motivation.

## Evidence
A meta-analysis of experiements showed that over 100 confirmed experiements of this

Deci, E.L., Koestner, R., Ryan, R.M., 1999. A meta-analytic review of experiments
examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. Psychological
Bulletin 125, 627–668.

# Internalization

Ryan et al. (1985)
addressed that issue with the concept of internalization,
which had been an important concept in developmental
psychology for manyyears, and they suggested that people tend
to internalize material endorsed by significant others in order
to satisfy a basic psychological need for relatedness

"However, the researchers pointed out that internalization,
which is a natural part of the integrative process, may not
always function wholly effectively so motivations sometimes
get only partially internalized and thus not fully integrated."

" it became
clear that the distinction between autonomous and controlled
motivation was the most useful and appropriate as the primary
distinction in SDT"

# Amotivation
 "People tend to be amotivated for
a behavior when they do not feel competent to do it or when
they do not value the outcomes that are likely to follow from
the behaviors."


# Causality Orientations
"The three causality orientation dimensions are the
autonomous orientation, the controlled orientation, and the
impersonal orientation"
- More like personality traits
"The autonomous orientation is
related to self-esteem and self-actualization; the controlled
488 Self-Determination Theory
orientation is related to public self-consciousness and the
type-A coronary-prone behavior pattern; and the impersonal
orientation is related to self-derogation and depressive
symptoms."

"This concept of causality orien-
tations is viewed as a developmental outcome – that is, it is said
to result from the mix of supporting versus thwarting of the
basic psychological needs during one’s developmental years"

"When all of the needs are satisfied over time, in homes,schools,
and elsewhere, while children are growing up, they tend to
develop a relatively strong autonomy orientation"

## Controlled Orientation origins
When the competence and relatedness needs are supported, but the need
for autonomy is thwarted, people tend to develop a fairly
strong controlled orientation

## Impersonal Orientation
"and when all of the needs are
relatively thwarted, people tend to develop a high level of the
impersonal orientation."

# Basic Psychological Needs
when people experience satisfaction of the three basic
psychological needs, they do indeed evidence greater health
and well-being.

## Examples
Second, the promotion of autonomous motivation and
wellness has been shown developmentally. For example,
studies have shown that when the social contexts of either
homes or classrooms were autonomy supportive of young
students, the students tended, over time, to develop stronger
identifications with the importance of doing schoolwork – that
is, they internalized this value and regulation more fully
(Grolnick and Ryan, 1989)

"For example, when elementary school teachers were more
need supportive, their students were more intrinsically moti-
vated and showed higher self-esteem"

" when instructors in
a college course were more need supportive the students
became more autonomously motivated for the course over the
semester, understood the material better, and received higher
grades in the course"


 In general,
when the social context is more need supportive and people are
more autonomously motivated for learning, they learn in
a deeper more conceptual way, whereas, when the context is
controlling or the learners are controlled in their motivation,
they tend to do well at memorizing facts, but they show low
levels of conceptual understanding (Ryan and Deci, 2009).

"A study of employees in a work setting showed that when
managers became more need supportive the employees were
more satisfied with their jobs and more trusting of the
company"

"A study of investment bankers showed that when
Self-Determination Theory 489
managers were more autonomy supportive, their employees
performed better at their jobs and also showed better psycho-
logical well-being. These employees having higher autono-
mous causality orientations also contributed to their
performing well and feeling good. In general, work settings that
are more need supportive and workers who are more autono-
mously motivated have been found to yield more positive
work outcomes (e.g., Baard et al., 2004)."

"In the domain of health care, for example, research has
found that when physicians were need supportive, the patients
were more autonomously motivated to take their medications
and in turn showed greater medication adherence. Other
research showed that when medical practitioners were more
need supportive for diabetic patients, the patents’ health
improved (Ryan et al., 2008b)."

"n research on virtual worlds, results indicate that when
players experience more satisfaction of the basic psychological
needs while playing the games they are more intrinsically
motivated for and more immersed in the games (Rigby and
Ryan, 2011). They have also shown that much of the basis
for players’ aggression during or following game play is
a function of their needs having been thwarted while playing."

# Goals

"Specifically, SDT has focused on the degree to
which people place value on what are called extrinsic life goals
or aspirations, such as wealth, fame, and image, relative to
intrinsic life goals such as personal growth, relationships, and
community."

Research has shown that when people value the extrinsic
aspirations more strongly than the intrinsic aspirations, they
tend also to display poor psychological health, whereas when
they value the intrinsic aspirations more strongly, they are
psychologically healthier (Kasser and Ryan, 1996)

Furthermore, research has shown that people tend to value
the extrinsic aspirations when they have had a low level of basic
psychological need satisfaction during their years as children,
but they tend to value intrinsic aspirations when they have had
a high level of basic satisfaction during those years (Kasser
et al., 1995).

"When, for example, business students who were
learning about communications were told that it would help
them learn about themselves, which is an intrinsic goal, their
learning and performance was better than when the students
were told that it would help them make more money, which is
an extrinsic goal (Vansteenkiste et al., 2004)."


# Close Relationships
 Much of the SDT research has focused on the importance
of autonomy in close relationships. Some theorists have argued
that to have a satisfying close relationship people need to give
up autonomy in service of the dyad, but SDT has argued that
autonomy, as well as relatedness and competence, must be
satisfied within a relationship in order for the relationship to
be high quality and truly satisfying.

"Studies have shown that indeed the degree to which people
experience autonomy in a particular relationship predicts the
degree of attachment security in that relationship"

" For each of the partners,
autonomy need satisfaction directly predicted security of
attachment in the relationship (La Guardia et al., 2000)."

# Self-Determination Theory in Work Organizations : The STate of a Science (2017)

" When individuals understand the worth and purpose of their jobs, feel ownership and
autonomy in carrying them out, and receive clear feedback and supports, they are likely to become
more autonomously motivated and reliably perform better, learn better, and be better adjusted. In
contrast, when motivation is controlled, either through contingent rewards or power dynamics,
the extrinsic focus that results can narrow the range of employees’ efforts, produce short-term
gains on targeted outcomes, and have negative spillover effects on subsequent performance and
work engagement."

"Intrinsic
motivation is a ubiquitous human phenomenon, but it is exemplified in the play of children, who
enthusiastically engage in activities without external rewards or prompts."

" However, intrinsic mo-
tivationisalsoevidentintheactivitiesofadults,suchassportsandavocations,anditissurprisingly
important even in in the workplace. Employees can be intrinsically motivated for at least parts of
their jobs, if not for all aspects of them, and when intrinsically motivated the individuals tend to
display high-quality performance and wellness."

 These
experiments were important in showing systematic effects of different reward contingencies on
intrinsic motivation, but perhaps more important was that they suggested that rewards could
shift people’s perceived locus of causality or perceived competence, thus diminishing their sense
of autonomy and/or their sense of competence

- Extrinsic motivation is not bad
" Rather than viewing all extrinsic motivation as “bad,” which some
authors(e.g.,Gerhart&Fang2015)haveclaimedwedid,SDThasalwaysmaintainedthatextrinsic
rewards can have different functional significances that lead to enhancements, diminishments, or
no effects on intrinsic motivation (e.g., Deci 1972)"

Autonomous motivation has also been examined as a moderator of relations between other
pairs of variables. For example, Trépanier et al. (2013a) found that employees high in autonomous
motivation experienced less stress in the presence of high job demands than did those low in
autonomous motivation.

## REgarding satisfying SDT basic needs
"Research with these
variables found that satisfaction of the three needs led to less exhaustion (Van den Broeck et al.
2008)andlessorganizationaldevianceonthepartofemployees(Lianetal.2012)"

"Finally,ameta-analysisof119distinct
samples showed that each of the three basic need satisfactions predicted independent variance in
intrinsic motivation and well-being, although it indicated that the need satisfactions were less
effective in predicting negative outcomes than positive ones, leading the researchers to suggest
using need frustration as well as need satisfaction as a predictor (Van den Broeck 2016)."

"Gillet et al. (2012) did study both satisfaction and frustration of the basic psychological needs
of organizational employees, revealing that satisfaction of the three needs yielded greater hedonic
and eudaimonic well-being, whereas frustration of the three needs led to lower levels of each type
of well-being"

# Goals
SDT most often considers seven
aspirations that people may be pursuing as important over their lifetimes: financial wealth, recog-
nition or fame, attractive image, personal development, meaningful relationships, community
contributions, and physical fitness.

## Extrinsic goals
   - Financial wealth
   - Recognition or fame
   - Attractive image
## Intrinsic goal
   - personal development
   - meaningful relationships
   - community contributions
   - physical fitness


# Pursue intrinsic goals
"Research has
also shown that when people place relatively strong importance on the extrinsic aspirations, and
also when they attain the extrinsic aspirations they desire, they tend to show signs of psychological
ill-being, such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, whereas when they pursue and attain
intrinsic aspirations, they tend to show indications of psychological well-being, such as high self-
actualization and self-esteem (Kasser & Ryan 1996)"

# Increased productivity with intrinsic goals
Subsequently, Van den Broeck et al. (2010) found that those with more intrinsic work goals were more flexible in
their work than those with extrinsic goals, and Van den Broeck et al. (2011) found that individuals
with relatively high intrinsic work aspirations who engaged in learning opportunities were less
emotionally exhausted than those with relatively higher extrinsic aspirations.

# On the pursuit of money
Another study, which was focused specifically on the aspiration for money (Landry et al. 2016),
found that the outcomes associated with aspiring to accumulate money depended on one’s mo-
tive for doing so. More specifically, if people’s motives for pursuing wealth were more integrated
and thus were more need-satisfying and less need-frustrating, the aspiration was positively associ-
atedwithwell-beingandnegativelywithill-being.However,ifthemotiveswerelessintegratedand
thus were less need-satisfying and more need-frustrating, the aspiration was positively associated
with ill-being and negatively associated with well-being.

# Study on lawyers and money
Sheldon & Krieger (2014) identified large samples of private-firm lawyers who had high-
paying jobs within money-focused firms (e.g., doing securities-related work) and public-service
lawyers who had jobs focused on serving the public (e.g., doing sustainability-related work for
nonprofit organizations). As one would expect, those lawyers in the money-focused jobs had
greater extrinsic aspirations relative to the public service group. They also had much larger annual
incomes, suggesting they were getting what they valued. Nonetheless this money-focused group
reported greater negative affect, lower well-being, and more alcohol consumption compared to
a group of public service attorneys. Here, evidence shows that even a successful focus on the
attainment of extrinsic goals does not reliably yield more happiness or well-being.

# Intervention studies
The first was taking the employees’ perspective, which
involves really listening to and understanding their ideas, asking for their viewpoints, thinking
about how you might understand the situation if you were in their position, and allowing them to
express their emotions in difficult situations

 The second concept was to facilitate the employees’
taking more initiative by allowing more group participation in decision making, and encouraging
individuals to make choices about how to do aspects of their own jobs.


The third concept was
providing informational feedback rather than controlling and demeaning feedback.

So,managerslearnedtogivemorepositivefeedbackthatwasspecifictothebehaviorstheir
peers and employees had done well and that was not formulated in terms of the recipients’ worth
as individuals.

# Transformation leadership vs transactional
In contrast to transformational leadership is transactional leadership, which is a more con-
ventional approach that includes using contingent rewards, emphasizing norms, and monitoring
employees’ behaviors.

# Role of Pay
Perhaps the most controversial sets of findings within the umbrella of SDT is directly related to
pay—namely, the findings concerning reward effects on intrinsic motivation and related concepts.

"The first studies of reward effects on intrinsic motivation for an activity revealed that tangible
rewardsunderminedintrinsicmotivationfortheactivity,whereaspositivefeedback(referredtoby
some as verbal rewards) enhanced intrinsic motivation (Deci 1971)"

"Furthermore, if the tangible
rewards were not contingent on actually doing the task they were not undermining of intrinsic
motivation (Deci 1972)"
"We interpreted this set of findings in terms of whether the functional
significance of the rewards was informational or controlling (Deci & Ryan 1980)"

"When the inter-
pretation of rewards is informational they convey positive competence information thus satisfying
the recipient’s basic psychological need for competence and enhancing intrinsic motivation"

" Often
tangible rewards have this functional significance (Deci et al. 1999), although when they are not
contingent on doing the task they are neither informational nor controlling so they tend not to
affect intrinsic motivation."

# Types of rewards
1. Engagement contingent
   - Hourly pay
2. Completion contingent
   - Sales commissions
3. Performance contingent
   - Pay-for-performance (PFP)
   - Bonuses
4. Non-contingent
   - salaries

Contingent rewards have been differentiated into three types: engagement-contingent, which
means receiving rewards simply for working on the task; completion-contingent, which means
receiving rewards for each task trial completed; and performance-contingent, which means re-
ceiving rewards for meeting some standard of excellence on the task

"All three types of tangible
rewards have been shown on average to significantly decrease intrinsic motivation, although the
performance-contingent rewards have had a somewhat smaller negative effect than the other two
contingencies."

"The performance-contingent rewards were somewhat controlling because partic-
ipants had to do very well to get the rewards, and they were somewhat informational because
getting the rewards confirmed the recipients’ competence"

"Using controlling rewards in a workplace may not only diminish employees’ autonomy; it can
also lead them to focus on aspects of their jobs to which the rewards are most clearly linked and
to give less attention to aspects of the jobs that are not incentivized (e.g., knowledge sharing,
team contributions, organizational citizenship behaviors) but that are nonetheless valuable to the
organizations"

# Difference between heuristic tasks and algorithmic tasks
Nearly 40 years ago, McGraw (1978) noted the
difference between algorithmic and heuristic tasks and reviewed evidence showing that rewards
tended to enhance performance on algorithmic tasks and diminish performance on heuristic tasks

We use the quantity-quality distinction to encompass the three
distinctions just presented.

"In a similar vein, Weibel et al. (2010) in their meta-analysis found that extrinsic
incentives led to better performance on simple tasks but to poorer performance on more complex
tasks"

"In short, PFP appears to be effective for motivating performance as quantity of simple,
algorithmic tasks, but not performance as quality of complex heuristic tasks. Furthermore, PFP
seems to interfere with the relation of intrinsic motivation to high-quality performance."

"Analyses of the data revealed that amount of pay was positively related to distributive justice,
indicating that the more pay employees received, the more just they believed the payments to
be. That is, greater pay does lead to employees feeling more fairly treated and valued"

" Base salaries, which
are more related to noncontingent rewards, were shown in the Deci et al. (1999) meta-analysis
and the Olafsen et al. (2015) field study to not affect autonomous motivation, although they were
found in the Kuvaas et al. (2016) study to correlate with autonomous motivation, suggesting that
further research is needed in workplaces to clarify the relation of salaries (i.e., noncontingent pay)
or hourly compensation (i.e., engagement-contingent pay) to autonomous motivation. In general,
however, it is likely that higher base salaries (i.e., noncontingent pay) have a positive influence, as
they may well convey valuing by the organization."

"The three studies just reviewed, when combined with the results of laboratory experiments,
other field studies, and meta-analyses, indicate that PFP approaches to compensation, in spite of
being strongly endorsed by writers such as Gerhart & Fang (2015), promote quantity of perfor-
mance largely for simple, algorithmic tasks, but do not enhance high-quality performance"

"In terms of rewards and pay, SDT research has consistently shown that whether rewards have a
positiveeffect,noeffect,oranegativeeffectonintrinsicmotivationandinternalizationdependson
their functional significance, which is influenced by the type of rewards (positive feedback versus
tangible rewards), the type of reward contingency, which we have discussed in detail, and the in-
terpersonalcontextwithinwhichtheyareadministered(autonomy-supportiveversuscontrolling)."

" Anyone interested in improving the work context within an organization and
thus the performance and wellness of its employees could evaluate any policy or practice being
considered in terms of whether it is likely to (a) allow the employees to gain competencies and/or
feel confident, (b) experience the freedom to experiment and initiate their own behaviors and not
feel pressured and coerced to behave as directed, and (c) feel respect and belonging in relation
to both supervisors and peers. "

# Motivation to Speak English:
A Self-Determination Theory Perspective

Most of the
time in language classrooms, students do not want to speak for a
number of reasons
1. fear of making a mistake
2. the fear of
their teachers
3.  feeling embarrassed if their peers laugh at their
mistakes
4. low self-esteem and confidence,
5. a lack of vocabulary and
fluency,
6. setting unrealistic goals, such as being as good as a native
speaker, 
7. negative self-perceptions of language competence,
8. teachers’ negative demeanour and attitude (Ariyanti, 2016; Cutrone,
2009; Dwyer & Heller-Murphy, 1996; Khan & Ali, 2010; Liu &
Jackson, 2008, 2011; Nation & Newton, 2009; Riasati, 2014; Shumin,
2002; Subaşı, 2010; Thornbury, 2005; Woodrow, 2007).

 Higher
verbal ability was related to integrative and intrinsic motivation to
speak English.

"They said that they
become more motivated when the teacher listens to them, gives
informative feedback, sets up an anxiety-free atmosphere, offers
choices etc."

"They complained about the course hours,
coursebooks, and the lack of language competency-based activities,
which lessened their motivation to speak English."

"The increasing amount of time allocated to
speaking, choosing personally relevant, familiar and interesting topics,
developing a listening habit, having personal needs with regard to
learning English, expressing options, and lessening dependency on the
written materials will all increase students’ willingness to speak
English and decrease their reticence in the class (Kayi, 2006; Kellem,
2009; Khan & Ali, 2010; Liu & Jackson, 2008, 2011; Riasati, 2014)."

# GAGNE and DECI (2005)
"Intrinsic motivation involves people doing an
activity because they find it interesting and derive spontaneous satisfaction from the activity itself.
Extrinsic motivation, in contrast, requires an instrumentality between the activity and some separable
consequences such as tangible or verbal rewards, so satisfaction comes not from the activity itself but
rather from the extrinsic consequences to which the activity leads"

" Specifically, early studies testing the additivity hypoth-
esis found that tangible extrinsic rewards undermined intrinsic motivation whereas verbal rewards
enhanced it (Deci, 1971)"

# Cognitive Evaluation Theory
"Cognitive evaluation theory suggested first that external factors such as tangible rewards, deadlines
(Amabile, DeJong, & Lepper, 1976), surveillance (Lepper & Greene, 1975), and evaluations (Smith,
1975) tend to diminish feelings of autonomy, prompt a change in perceived locus of causality (PLOC)
from internal to external (deCharms, 1968; Heider, 1958), and undermine intrinsic motivation"

"In con-
trast, some external factors such as providing choice about aspects of task engagement tend to enhance
feelings of autonomy, prompt a shift in PLOC from external to internal, and increase intrinsic motiva-
tion (Zuckerman et al., 1978)."

"CET further suggested that feelings of competence as well as feelings of autonomy are important for
intrinsic motivation. Studies showed that optimally challenging activities were highly intrinsically
motivating (e.g., Danner & Lonky, 1981) and that positive feedback (Deci, 1971) facilitated intrinsic
motivation by promoting a sense of competence when people felt responsible for their successful per-
formance (Fisher, 1978; Ryan, 1982)"

# Unexpected rewards did not decrease intrinsic motivation
TheDecietal. (1999)meta-analysis alsoconfirmedCET hypothesesthatspecifiedlimitingconditions
to the undermining effect. Namely, it showed that when rewards were given independent of specific task
engagement (as might be the case with a salary) or when the rewards were not anticipated (as might be
the case with unexpected bonuses), tangible extrinsic rewards did not undermine intrinsic motivation.


"Research in line with CET has also shown that contingent, tangible rewards and other extrinsic fac-
tors such as competition and evaluations can be detrimental to outcomes such as creativity, cognitive
flexibility, and problem solving which have been found to be associated with intrinsic motivation (e.g.,
Amabile, Goldfarb, & Brackfield, 1990; McGraw, 1978)"

# Issues with CET
First, most studies that tested CET were laboratory experiments rather than organizational studies.
Second, it was difficult to incorporate CET propositions into the prevalent behavioral and expectancy–
valence approaches. Third, and more practically, many activities in work organizations are not intrin-
sically interesting and the use of strategies such as participation to enhance intrinsic motivation is not
always feasible. Fourth, most people who work have to earn money, so using monetary rewards as a
central motivational strategy seems practical and appealing.

" Fifth, CET seemed to imply that managers
and management theorists would have to focus on one or the other—that is, either on promoting intrin-
sic motivation through participation and empowerment while minimizing the use of extrinsic factors
or, alternatively, on using rewards and other extrinsic contingencies to maximize extrinsic motivation
while ignoring the importance of intrinsic motivation."

# Internalization
 Internalization refers to ‘taking in’ a behavioral
regulation and the value that underlies it.

"Central to SDT is the distinction between autonomous motivation and controlled motivation."

# Extrinsic motivation and the autonomy continuum
Activities that are not
interesting (i.e., that are not intrinsically motivating) require extrinsic motivation, so their initial enact-
ment depends upon the perception of a contingency between the behavior and a desired consequence
such as implicit approval or tangible rewards.


"When externally
regulated, people act with the intention of obtaining a desired consequence or avoiding an undesired
one, so they are energized into action only when the action is instrumental to those ends (e.g., I work
when the boss is watching)"

"Other types of extrinsic motivation result when a behavioral regulation and thevalue associated with
it have been internalized. Internalization is defined as people taking in values, attitudes, or regulatory
structures, such that the external regulation of a behavior is transformed into an internal regulation and
thus no longer requires the presence of an external contingency (thus, I work even when the boss is not
watching)"

# Introjected
A regulation that has been taken in by the person but has not been accepted as his or her own is said
to be introjected and provides the basis for introjected regulation

" Examples of introjected regulation include contingent self-
esteem, which pressures people to behave in order to feel worthy, and ego involvement, which pres-
sures people to behave in order to buttress their fragile egos(deCharms, 1968; Ryan, 1982). Introjected
regulation is particularly interesting because the regulation is within the person but is a relatively con-
trolled form of internalized extrinsic motivation (e.g., I work because it makes me feel like a worthy
person)."

"Being autonomously extrinsically motivated requires that people identify with the value of a beha-
vior for their own self-selected goals. With identified regulation, people feel greater freedom and voli-
tion because the behavior is more congruent with their personal goals and identities"

"They perceive the cause of their behavior to have an internal PLOC—that is, to reflect an aspect of themselves."

# Integrated
"With integrated regulation, people have a full sense that the beha-
vior is an integral part of who they are, that it emanates from their sense of self and is thus self-deter-
mined"
"Thus, the profession of nurse would be more central to their iden-
tity, they would be more likely to act in ways that are consistent with caring for people more generally,
and they could come to appreciate the importance of doing uninteresting activities."

"Integrated regulation does not, however, become intrinsic motivation but is still con-
sidered extrinsic motivation (albeit an autonomous form of it) because the motivation is characterized
not by the person being interested in the activity but rather by the activity being instrumentally impor-
tant for personal goals."

"Rather, the theory describes these types of regulation in order to index the extent to which people have
integrated the regulation of a behavior or class of behaviors."

"According to SDT, satisfaction of these two needs are also necessary for internalization to operate effectively, but a third basic need—the need for relatedness—is also crucial for internalization (e.g.,
Baumeister & Leary, 1995). More specifically, SDT postulates that when people experience satisfac-
tion of the needs for relatedness and competence with respect to a behavior, they will tend to interna-
lize its value and regulation, but the degree of satisfaction of the need for autonomy is what
distinguishes whether identification or integration, rather than just introjection, will occur.


"According to this definition, something is a need only to the extent that its satisfaction promotes
psychological health and its thwarting undermines psychological health."

"With respect to organizations, we argue, based largely on laboratory experiments and field research
in other domains, that work climates that promote satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs
will enhance employees’ intrinsic motivation and promote full internalization of extrinsic motivation
and that this will in turn yield the important work outcomes of (1) persistence and maintained behavior
change; (2) effective performance, particularly on tasks requiring creativity, cognitive flexibility, and
conceptual understanding; (3) job satisfaction; (4) positive work-related attitudes; (5) organizational
citizenship behaviors; and (6) psychological adjustment and well-being."

# Social Context and Internalization
One the most important reasons for postulating that there are basic psychological needs, defined as we
have done, is that they provide the basis for predicting which aspects of a social context will support
intrinsic motivation and facilitate internalization of extrinsic motivation

"We noted earlier that autonomy support is the most important social-contextual factor for predicting
identification and integration, and thus autonomous behavior. Indeed, several studies have found
autonomy-supportive interpersonal environments to promote internalization and integration of extrin-
sic motivation and in turn positive outcomes."

"o examine specific factors that constitute autonomy support and facilitate internalization of extrin-
sic motivation, Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, and Leone (1994) performed a laboratory experiment. They
found that three specific factors—a meaningful rationale for doing the task, acknowledgment that peo-
ple might not find the activity interesting, and an emphasis on choice rather than control—led to
greater internalization, assessed both by the amount of time participants spent with the task during
a subsequent free-choice period and by their self-reported attitudes toward the task."

# Two types of autonomy support
Supports for autonomy fall within two
general categories: (1) specific factors in the social context, such as choice and meaningful positive
feedback, which can be thought of as being analogous to specific aspects of job contents and contexts;
and (2) the interpersonal ambience, which can be thought of as being analogous to the organizational
climate and managers’ interpersonal styles.

# Difference between autonomy support for intrinsic motivation vs extrinsic motivation
 there are two notable differences between the factors that maintain
intrinsic motivation and those that facilitate internalization. First, people do not necessarily require
structures, limits, or contingencies to maintain intrinsic motivation, but these are essential elements
for internalization because it is they that get internalized. Second, internalization is facilitated by
explicit or implicit endorsement of behaviors by significant others, whereas that is less important
for maintaining intrinsic motivation.

"Specifically, as we will see later, autonomous extrinsic motivation is more predictive than
is intrinsic motivation for behaviors that are not themselves interesting and require discipline and
explicit effort (Koestner & Losier, 2002)."

# Individual Differences
Referred to as general causality orientations (Deci & Ryan, 1985b), they index the
degree to which people are autonomy oriented, control oriented, and impersonally oriented

The autonomy orientation reflects a general tendency to experience social contexts as autonomy suppor-
tive and to be self-determined; 

the control orientation reflects a general tendency to experience social
contexts as controlling and to be controlled;

 and the impersonal orientation reflects the general ten-
dency to be amotivated

"Research (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 1985b; Hodgins, Koestner, & Duncan, 1996;
Koestner, Bernieri, & Zuckerman, 1992; Williams et al., 1996; Vallerand, 1997) has shown that the
autonomy orientation is positively related to self-actualization, self-esteem, ego development, integra-
tion in personality, and satisfying interpersonal relationships;"

the control orientation is associated
with public self-consciousness, the Type A behavior pattern, defensive functioning, and placing high
importance on pay and other extrinsic motivators;

 and that the impersonal orientation is related to
external locus of control (i.e., the belief that one can not control outcomes) and to self-derogation
and depression.

# Type A
Most people now know that Type A personality characteristics have something to do with being competitive and work-obsessed and can bring an increased risk of health problems

# Other Models of Motivation

Even theories such as Porter and Lawler’s (1968)
that distinguish intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation consider them to be additive, with total
motivation being the critical motivational predictor.

"Within the field of work motivation, as in the broader field of motivated or regulated behavior, much of
the work falls within the cognitive tradition that evolved out of the work of Lewin (1936) and Tolman
(1932). Within that tradition, many theories have been greatly influenced by the cybernetic approach
(e.g., Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) and the expectancy–valence approach (e.g., Atkinson,
1964; Vroom, 1964). Although the theories are highly varied, there is one aspect that is common to
most of them; namely, that motivation for action is treated as a unitary concept that varies in amount
rather than kind. In otherwords, the totalmotivation a person has may be determined by various factors
but represents a single variable that provides the basis for making predictions. Thus, the central moti-
vational issue in most theories is the amount of total motivation a person has for a task, so the type of
motivation is not considered in making predictions."


# Goal setting theory
Locke and Latham’s (1990) goal-setting theory has had a substantial impact in the field of work moti-
vation

In contrast, SDT proposes that autonomous motivation and intrinsic goals are
better predictors of effective performance on heuristic tasks (Vansteenkiste et al., 2004), whereas the
two types of motivation do not differ in predicting effective algorithmic performance, particularly over
the long term (see, for example, McGraw, 1978)

"They suggested that people’s
goal representations are the efficient causes of behavior and that people’s performance will be max-
imized when (1) they set specific, difficult goals that have high valence and (2) they understand what
behaviors will lead to the goals and feel competent to do those behaviors."

"Working with this general approach, Frese (1989) suggested that control over one’s beha-
vior (i.e., decision latitude), combined with optimal complexity of the task and without undue com-
plicatedness, leads to optimal performance and well-being"


# Kanfer’s task-specific motivation
Kanfer (1987; Kanfer & Ackerman, 1989, 2004) has outlined a theory of work motivation that falls in
the same general cognitive tradition as action theory. It uses the interaction of motivation and indivi-
dual differences in abilities as a primary basis for predicting work performance

Motivation is char-
acterized in terms of two cognitive resource allocation processes, referred to as distal and proximal.
Distal factors concern mechanisms such as the utility to the person of doing the task and the perceived
instrumentality of expending effort for effective performance. When the target activities are relatively
complex and require sustained effort, proximal factors such as self-monitoring and self-regulation are
critical for performance and competence development.

# Job characteristics theory
Hackman and Oldham (1980) argued that the most effective means of motivating individuals is
through the optimal design of jobs.
The authors proposed that the means for increasing internal
work motivation is to design jobs so they will (1) provide variety, involve completion of a whole,
and have a positive impact on the lives of others; (2) afford considerable freedom and discretion to
the employee (what action theorists refer to as decision latitude); and (3) provide meaningful perfor-
mance feedback

SDT supports
 Research by Deci, Connell, and Ryan (1989) found that when managers were trained to be more
autonomy supportive—that is, to understand subordinates’ perspectives, encourage their initiative,
and provide feedback in an autonomy-supportive rather than controlling way—their subordinates.
became more trusting of the organization and displayed more positive work-related attitudes.

SDT does not focus on need strength as an individual difference but instead considers causality orien-
tations as the individual difference

# Needs and motives: Maslow, Herzberg, and Alderfer
The theories of Maslow (1954), Herzberg (1966), and Alderfer (1972) are considered classics in orga-
nizational behavior.

" In the work of Maslow and Alderfer there are five and three classes of needs,
respectively, organized in a hierarchy from the basic, lower-order needs such as the physiological
drives to higher-order needs for actualization or growth."

# Kelman's theory of internalization

Kelman (1958) presented a differentiated theory of internalization or attitude change positing that a
person’s attitude-related behavior can either be compliant and short lived or can be enduringly influ-
enced by others if (1) the person identifies with the others, or (2) the behavior is congruent with the
person’s values

"In other words, although an iden-
tification or perceived connection with another could prompt a person’s behavior, the behavioral reg-
ulation could be either (1) controlled (i.e., performed so the person would receive real or imagined
approval from that other) or (2) autonomous (i.e., performed based on the individual’s understanding
and acceptance of the personal importance of the behavior for himself or herself). Thus, behavior that
is said to be regulated by identification in Kelman’s use of that term could correspond to regulation that
results from either introjection or identification using SDT’s definitions of the terms."

# Organizational commitment
Two theories have presented differentiated views of organizational commitment. First, O’Reilly and
Chatman (1986) used Kelman’s (1958) typology to distinguish three forms of organizational commit-
ment, including (a) identification with the organization, (b) internalization of the organization’s values,
and (c) compliance

In the second theory of commitment, Allen and Meyer (1996) specified three forms of commitment.
Affective commitment refers to employees’ identification with, emotional attachment to, and involve-
ment in the organization, which is the type of commitment in their taxonomy that is theoretically most
aligned with autonomous motivation. 

# More evidence that pay for performance has unintended consequences
"First, Eden (1975) reported a negative relation between the perception of
extrinsic rewards and the amount of intrinsic motivation among kibbutz workers, and Deckop and
Cirka (2000) found that the introduction of merit-pay programs in a non-profit organization led to
decreased feelings of autonomy and intrinsic motivation, thus providing some indication that rewards
can undermine intrinsic motivation in work settings. Further, Shirom, Westman, and Melamed (1999)
found that pay-for-performance plans led to lower well-being in blue-collar workers, especially for
those who felt their jobs were monotonous."

". For example, Benware and Deci (1984) found autonomous motivation to be significantly super-
ior to controlled motivation for facilitating conceptual understanding of text material, butthe two types
of motivation did not differ in promoting rote learning of facts contained within the reading. Other
studies found that controlled motivation led to better performance on mundane tasks (Grolnick &
Ryan, 1987; McGraw, 1978), although Grolnick and Ryan reported that the advantage had worn off
within a week."

"Research by Koestner and Losier (2002) has highlighted another important difference, namely that
intrinsic motivation yielded better performance on tasks that are interesting but that autonomous extrinsic motivation yielded better performance on tasks that are not in themselves interesting but that
are important and require discipline or determination.

"Together, the studies suggest that autonomous
motivation, consisting of a mix ofintrinsic motivation and internalized extrinsic motivation, is superior
in situations that include both complex tasks that are interesting and less complex tasks that require
discipline. "

" This implies that, overall, autonomous motivation
is preferable in organizations because even with dull, boring jobs there is an advantage to autonomous
motivation in terms of job satisfaction and well-being, which are likely to yield better attendance and
lower turnover (Breaugh, 1985; Karasek & Theorell, 1990; Matteson & Ivancevich, 1987; Sherman,
1989).


# Propositions

"Proposition 1: Autonomous extrinsic motivation will be more effective in predicting persistence on
uninteresting but effort-driven tasks, whereas intrinsic motivation will be more effective in predict-
ing persistence on interesting tasks."

"Specifically, the theory sug-
gests that intrinsic motivation concerns experiencing activities as interesting and spontaneously
satisfying, whereas autonomous extrinsic motivation concerns experiencing activities not as interest-
ing but as personally important for one’s self-selected aims and purposes. Empirically, the theory sug-
gests the two types of autonomous motivation will be differentially effective in predicting various
outcomes, with intrinsic motivation being a better predictor of behaviors that are interesting and enjoy-
able in their own right, whereas identified/integrated regulation will be more effective in predicting
performance on tasks that require some discipline and concerted effort."

"Proposition 2: Controlled motivation will yield poorer performance on heuristic tasks than auton-
omous motivation, but will lead to equal to or better short-term performance on algorithmic tasks."

"Proposition 3: Autonomy-supportive work climates facilitate internalization of extrinsic motiva-
tion, resulting in more autonomous self-regulation of extrinsically motivated behavior."

"Proposition 4: Specific aspects of jobs interact with the work climates to influence autonomous
motivation for work."

 Many have identified aspects that undermine intrinsic motivation and
deter internalization, including various reward structures (Deci et al., 1999), imposition of goals
(Mossholder, 1980), and surveillance (Lepper & Greene, 1975), while others have focused on charac-
teristics that tend to enhance intrinsic motivation and facilitate internalization, including job
characteristics (Gagne ´ et al., 1997), acknowledgment (Deci et al., 1994), choice (Zuckerman et al.,
1978), and positive feedback (Deci et al., 1975; Ryan, 1982)

# Intrinsic Motivation affectors
- Reward structures (negative)
- Imposing goals (negative)
- Surveillance (negative)
- job characterics (positive)
- acknowledgement (positive)
- choice (positive)
- positive feedback (positive)


In one such study, Ryan et al.
(1983) found that, relative to a control group that received no rewards and no feedback,
participants who received performance-contingent rewards administered in an autonomy-supportive
interpersonal climate evidenced higher intrinsic motivation, whereas those who received perfor-
mance-contingent rewards administered in a controlling interpersonal climate showed lower intrinsic
motivation.

"Proposition 5: Concrete managerial behaviors that support subordinates’ autonomy in the work-
place can be identified empirically."

"n such studies, autonomy support, which is defined in
terms of understanding and acknowledging the subordinates’ perspectives, encouraging self-initiation,
minimizing pressures and controls, and providing relevant information, has been measured as a general
concept using psychometric instruments"

"Proposition 6: Employees’ autonomous causality orientations and autonomy-supportive work
climates will have additive, independent positive effects on employees’ autonomous motivation
and positive work outcomes."

# Organizational citizenship
 This concerns volun-tary behaviors that are not directly recognized by the formal reward structure but do promote
organizational effectiveness. Examples include helping co-workers, formulating innovations, serving
on committees, and helping to organize work group events (e.g., Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Bommer,
1996).

" One showed that parental support of college
students’ autonomy predicted satisfaction of the students’ basic needs for competence, relatedness,
and autonomy, which in turn predicted the amount the students engaged in prosocial activities such
as giving blood and volunteering."

"Further, Pelletier et al. (1998) found that autonomous extrinsic motivation
was more predictive of pro-environmental behaviors than was intrinsic motivation, supporting the
point made by Losier and Koestner (1999) that uninteresting but important activities that require
disciplined enactment are best promoted by integrated extrinsic motivation."

"For example, Fabes et al. (1989) found that rewarding children
for helping undermined their subsequent helping behavior, and Kunda and Schwartz (1983) found that
payments decreased undergraduates’ helping behavior by undermining their internalized sense of moral
commitment to help. Upton (1974) reported that committed blood donors who received a reward were
subsequently less likely to donate compared to committed donors who were not offered a reward (see
also Batson, Coke, Jasnoski, & Hanson, 1978). Sobus (1995) studied mandatory volunteering programs
in schools and argued that such programs rob people of their sense of self-determination."

"SDTalso provides a framework for integrating and extending Bolino’s (1999) proposition that orga-
nizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) can be enacted either for altruistic or for impression manage-
ment reasons. He proposed that OCB enacted for impression management reasons (e.g., ingratiation
and self-promotion) may lead to different outcomes for organizations, such as having a less positive
impact on overall organizational effectiveness, than does OCB enacted for altruistic reasons"

"What is referred to as impression management reasons are examples of controlled motivation, and what is
referred to as altruistic reasons can be thought of as a type of autonomous motivation."

"We would, however, propose extending this to the broader prediction that
social contexts that are more controlling in whatever way—for example, because of certain reward
structures or pressure from managers—would be likely to result in external or introjected motivations
for OCB. That, we hypothesize, would lead to less long-term persistence at the OCBs.


# The satisfaction–performance relation reconsidered
As noted by Judge, Thoresen, Bono, and Patton (2001), research on the relation between performance
and satisfaction has been a central concern to I/O psychologists for decades. 

"As already noted, recent motivation research has emphasized the importance of distinguishing
between performance on interesting or important versus mundane or boring tasks (e.g., McGraw,
1978)"

"Our central speculation is that autonomous (versus controlled) motivation and the job content and
context factors that promote autonomous (versus controlled) motivation will moderate the relation
between job satisfaction and job performance.

"Judge et al. (2001) presented a framework for understanding this relation in which job complexity
was the most important substantive moderator of the relation. They concluded that when tasks were
more complex there would be a stronger positive correlation between satisfaction and performance."

# Reward effects revisited
contingent tangible extrinsic rewards for motivating behavior. As noted earlier, however, the Deci et al.
(1999) meta-analysis of reward effects showed a strong overall negative effect of tangible rewards on
intrinsic motivation, raising concerns about how intrinsic and extrinsic motivation would work
together positively.

"For example, Ryan et al. (1983) found that performance-contingent monetary rewards
administered in an autonomy-supportive context enhanced intrinsic motivation relative to a no-reward,
no-feedback control group, whereas those administered in a controlling context undermined intrinsic
motivation."

"The research thus indicated that rewards used to acknowledge competence can have a posi-
tive effect if the climate is autonomy supportive. Further, research has shown that rewards must be
perceived as equitable in order not to have negative effects (Adams, 1963)"

"Research suggests that autonomous work motivation is facilitated by environments in which jobs are
interesting, challenging, and allow choice and in which the work climate is autonomy supportive, as
well as by employees being high on the autonomous causality orientation"

# Job enlargement to support autonomy
Horizontal enlargement - allow workers to see different parts of the business, rotation model
Vertical enlargement - allow works to see the management side of things as well

"Autonomy-supportive work climates are ones in which managers are able to take employees’ per-
spectives, provide greater choice, and encourage self-initiation."

"As an example, Deci et al. (1994) found that a meaningful rationale for doing an uninteresting
behavior led people to internalize the value and regulation of the behavior"

"Second, people tend to feel resistance to doing an uninteresting task, and research has shown that acknowledging their perspective
and feelings about the task promotes internalization and autonomous regulation (Deci et al., 1994;
Koestner et al., 1984). For example, Deci et al. (1994) found that reflecting people’s feelings of finding
an important activity uninteresting facilitated integration of its value and regulation."

"Third, as already noted, the need for relatedness plays a central role in internalization of values and
regulations. Thus, structuring work to allow interdependence among employees and identification with
work groups, as well as being respectful and concerned about each employee, may have a positive
effect on internalization of autonomous motivation and work outcomes (van Knippenberg & van
Schie, 2000; Wall, Kemp, Jackson, & Clegg, 1986)."

" For example, James and Greenberg (1989) found that identifying
with a group, which facilitates internalization of group values, led to enhanced performance."

# LAN Guo - SDT and Performance Management Systems
- Agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976) assumes that the employee (the
agent) is self-interested and effort-averse. Accordingly, agency theorists mainly rely
on incentives (or reward contingencies) to induce the employee to take actions that
are congruent with firm objectives.

Employees are to a greater degree motivated by autonomous (vs. controlled)
motivation to work when:
a. the reward systems are well linked with performance measurement
systems than when they are not;
b. they participate in the processes of selecting performance measures,
setting performance targets and evaluating their own performance than
when they do not participate in such processes; and
c. PMS clearly communicate to them the business objectives than when they
do not.

When they are to a greater degree motivated by autonomous (vs. controlled)
motivation to work, employees:
a. to a greater degree recognize the importance of acquiring new knowledge
and skills;
b. are less vulnerable to the self-serving attributional bias, i.e., are less likely
to make stronger attribution to personal factors for success than for failure;
and
c. are more proactive in influencing the organization’s strategy formation.

"Adopting this strategic view of PMS, one can argue that the ultimate purpose
of PMS is to facilitate the achievement of the organization’s strategic objectives.
Accordingly, this paper assumes that desired PMS are the ones that effectively
motivate employees to achieve strategic objectives and to implement appropriate
strategies."

"Therefore, the focus of this paper is to examine how PMS characteristics
impact employees’ cognition and behaviors that have a direct effect on the attainment
of strategic objectives. For example, this paper examines how PMS characteristics
impact employees’ willingness to acquire new knowledge and skills as well as their
likelihood to proactively influence strategy development."

# Expectancy theory
Expectancy theory (Vroom 1964), assumes that motivation is a function of the
effort-outcome expectancy and the valence (or attractiveness) of the outcome.

# Agency theory
Agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976; Eisenhardt 1989) assumes that
individuals have a desire to increase personal wealth and to decrease the level of
effort. It also assumes that in an organization, the employee (the agent) has different
goals than does the employer (the principal), and it is expensive for the latter to verify
what the former is doing.

"Consistent with expectancy theory, agency theory advocates reward systems
that are sensitive to employees’ effort level. For example, agency theory proposes that
the more (less) the outcome is determined by employees’ effort, the more rewards
should be based on the outcome (behavior) (Eisenhardt 1989)."

"Agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976) assumes that the employee (the
agent) makes rational trade-offs between “effort costs” and expected utility from
his/her actions. The expected utility from his/her action can be both monetary reward
(e.g., bonus) and non-monetary reward (e.g., prestige)."

# Goal-setting theory
Influenced by Ryan’s (1970) belief that conscious goals affect human
behavior, goal-setting theory (Locke and Latham 1990) views personal goals as the
central stimuli of individuals’ behavior. According to this theory, certain attributes of
goals, such as their level of difficulty and specificity, are expected to impact
individuals’ performance. In particular, specific, and difficult but achievable goals
lead to optimal level of performance

"Presumably, goals affect performance by
directing attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities, by enhancing the level of
effort as well as persistence, and by leading to greater use of task-relevant knowledge
and strategies (Locke and Latham 2002)."

"Goal-setting theory further identifies factors that moderate the above-
mentioned goal-performance relation (Locke and Latham 1990). One of the most
documented moderators is goal commitment. "

"when individuals strive for certain
goals out of pressure or any other external force, rather than out of personal values or
simple enjoyment, negative outcomes such as low level of persistence and poor
psychological well-being may occur."

"This meta-analysis in general supported CET’s argument that tangible rewards,
if not implemented properly, can undermine individuals’ intrinsic motivation. In
contrast, verbal rewards enhanced intrinsic motivation as measured by both free-
choice persistence (d=0.33) and self-reported interest (d=0.31)."

"More importantly, many activities at work are not intrinsically
interesting. Therefore enhancing intrinsic motivation is not always practicable (Kunz
and Pfaff 2002; Gagné and Deci 2005). The next development of SDT, i.e., the
proposition of OIT (Deci and Ryan 1985a, 2000; Ryan and Deci 2000; Ryan and Deci
2002), reflects SDT researchers’ effort to address those challenges."

# Organismic Integration Theory (OIT)
From the perspective of OIT, not all types of extrinsic motivation are harmful.
Rather, autonomous types of extrinsic motivation are associated with various positive
outcomes including effective performance, persistence and psychological well-being.

"The basic premise of OIT is that as long as the social environment provides
sufficient support, people have the natural tendency to integrate their life experiences.
In other words, people tend to “take in” and further internalize external regulations
such as social norms, cultural practices, and significant others’ demand (Ryan and
 17
Deci 2002)."

# External regulation
In the case of external regulation, the least autonomous form of motivation,
behavior is performed primarily to satisfy an external demand or to obtain an
externally imposed reward contingency.

# Introjected
In the case of introjected regulation, individuals internalize the reasons for their actions although
they have not accepted the regulation as their own. 
"In the present context, employees strive for strategic goals because they would otherwise feel guilty or anxious, or they do so in
order to attain ego enhancements (an internal source), and not because their superior
requires it (external source)

# Identified
With identified regulation, behavior is performed out of choice because
individuals value the behavior.
For instance, employees would be motivated by
identified regulation if they strive for strategic goals because they think they are
important and they truly endorse them. 

# Integrated
In integrated regulation, individuals not only
internalize the reasons for their behavior, but they also assimilate them to the “self”.
In the present context, employees would be motivated by integrated regulation if
striving for strategic goals is not only important to them personally, but it is also
congruent with “personally endorsed values, goals, and needs that are already part of
the self” (Ryan and Deci 2002, p. 18)

# Intrinsic motivation
In the case of intrinsic motivation, employees
experience pleasure and satisfaction from the mere process of working toward
strategic goals.

# control motivation impact
For example, in educational settings, it is found that controlled motivation is
associated with less conceptual understanding of material and surface processing of
knowledge (Benware and Deci 1984; Elliot, McGregor and Gable 1999; Elliot and
McGregor 2001)
 In contrast, Vansteenkiste, Simons, Lens, Sheldon, and Deci (2004)
found that autonomous motivation predicts greater persistence and better performance
in learning

# RElatedness from Significant others
Very often, external regulation is initially brought about by significant others.
Just to name a few, parents demand children to behave at school, superiors reward
subordinates for achieving performance standards, or executives promotes newly
adopted strategies to lower-level employees. The target individuals, whether they are
the children, subordinates or lower-level employees, may perform desired activities
out of feeling connected with the significant others. Research has shown that
satisfaction of need for relatedness facilitates the process of internalization of external
regulation (e.g., Ryan, Stiller and Lynch 1994).

# Competence need
Satisfying individuals’ need for
competence is also important because if they do not feel competent to perform well on
the target behavior, individuals are less likely to internalize regulation of such
behavior (Vallerand 1997).

"OIT holds that without satisfying individuals’ need for autonomy, the support for relatedness and
competence can only result in introjected regulation (Ryan and Deci 2000)"

" To fully internalize external regulation, autonomy support is needed to help individuals “grasp
its meaning and synthesize that meaning with respect to their other goals and values”
(Ryan and Deci 2000, p.74)"

"Second, the attainment of personal goals does not ensure the enhancement of
psychological well-being. Specifically, Sheldon and Kasser (1998), and Kasser and
Ryan (2001) find that well-being is enhanced when intrinsic goals (e.g., personal
growth and community contribution) are attained, but not when extrinsic goals (fame" nd wealth) are attained. The reason is because the attainment of extrinsic goals does
not necessarily provide satisfaction of basic psychological needs.


# Causality orientations

The general causality orientations scale (GCOS) was
developed to measure the degree to which individuals are in general autonomy
oriented, control oriented, and impersonally oriented.

"For example, Neighbors and Knee (2003) find that
individuals scoring high on autonomy orientation, compared with those scoring low
on autonomy orientation, are less likely to experience a decrease in self-esteem and
affect when being compared with better performers"

# Comparing Agency theory with SDT

"they desire to work hard when the task is viewed as meaningful or interesting."
"Using
Maslow’s language, “duty is pleasant, and pleasure is the fulfilment of duty"

"However, experimental studies show that individuals do shirk when effort
level cannot be observed (e.g., Berg, Daley, Dickhaut, and O’Brien 1992)"

"It is also
shown that individuals tend to exploit their private information when they anticipate
by doing so their personal wealth can be increased (e.g., Baiman and Lewis 1989). It
appears that agency theory’s assumption about human nature is supported by
empirical evidence."

"Specifically, by surveying teenagers and their mothers, Kasser, Ryan,
Zax, and Sameroff (1995) find that when mothers are democratic, non-controlling and
warm, compared when they are controlling and distant, the teens are less likely to
value extrinsic goals"

# Debates on the basic nature of man
The debate on basic assumptions about human nature has its long history in
business research. For example, influenced by McGregor (1960) and Maslow (1970),
Argyris (1973) proposes a “self-actualizing” model of man.

"Argyris (1973) assumes that individuals “have a need to grow beyond their current
state and reach higher levels of achievement and that the assumptions of the
economic view of man limit people from attaining their full potential” (Davis,
Schoorman, and Donaldson 1997, p. 27)."

# Issues with performance incentives
Second, reward contingencies are often effective only within a limited
observable window, e.g., within the employment horizon or within compensation
contract window. In other words, only within that finite window, can the goal of the
agent be aligned with that of the principal or the firm objectives.

"In such a situation, if
solely motivated by the imposed reward contingency, the agent may not invest effort
to master new knowledge and skills that potentially leads to higher long-term firm
performance because he/she believes that such effort may not be compensated
(Dikolli 2001; Dutta and Reichelstein 2003)"

"Moreover, the agent may not be willing
to take risks that are associated with innovation and other proactive behaviors that
benefit long-term firm performance, unless he/she can charge the firm for risk
premium (Sprinkle 2003)."


"As summarized in section 2.3.2.2,
controlled motivation is associated with surface processing of knowledge, lower level
of persistence (Benware and Deci 1984, Elliot et al. 1999, Elliot and McGregor
2001), lower level of creativity (Amabile et al. 1986, Amabile et al. 1990),
unwillingness to carry out new strategy (Lynch et al. 2005), and reluctance to accept
organizational change (Illardi et al. 1993)"


# On love of money
"It is also found that among employees,
love of money (one type of extrinsic goal) is related to the propensity to perform
unethical behaviors (Tang and Chiu 2003)"


# Issue with Goal Setting
As argued by Merchant
and Manzoni (1989), when examining profit centers and when environmental
uncertainty/complexity is high, the explanatory power of goal-setting theory is
limited.

"Second, when individuals pursue personal goals in an
autonomous (vs. controlled) way, they tend to invest effort more persistently, and as a
result, are more likely to attain those goals."

"Second, influenced by
Vroom’s (1964) expectancy-valence framework, the valence of goal attainment is
defined functionally. In other words, goal attainment is viewed as attractive as long as
it bears utility, whether or not it actually satisfies individuals’ innate psychological
needs."

# Issues with setting the wrong organizational goals

"Agency theory based research on performance measurement systems often
holds that if the (combination of) performance measures are not congruent with firm
objectives, they will “induce managers to do the wrong things” (Merchant, 2006, p.
909)"


For example, a few analytical studies (e.g., Sliwka 2002; Dutta and Reichelstein
2003) demonstrate that under certain conditions, performance measurement systems
that do not include nonfinancial measures or leading indicators can lead to managers’
myopic behaviors

"In
other words, some of the performance measures (e.g., innovation) are contaminated, with greater noise than are other measures (e.g., sales increase). If employees are risk
averse (as assumed by agency theory), rewarding all dimensions of performance can
thus lead to a suboptimal allocation of effort and a decrease in overall firm
performance (Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991)


# On magnitude of pay and performance
Some other studies examine how the magnitude of pay affects task
performance. Empirical studies in this area provide mixed results. Specifically, some
studies suggest that increasing the level of payments have mixed effects on
performance, some show that increasing the level of payments tend to decrease
performance, while others show that the level of payments has no effect on
performance (Bonner and Sprinkle 2002).

# Setting wrong incentives can reduce long term competitiveness
"For example, employees’
readiness to take risks, to innovate, and to acquire new knowledge and skills is crucial
for firms’ long-term success.


# MOTIVATIONAL MODEL AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT

# Challenges to SDT
The “undermining” argument has been controversial since its first appearance
(Gagné and Deci 2005). Eisenberger and his colleagues (e.g., Eisenberger and Cameron
1996, 1998; Eisenberger, Rhoades and Cameron 1999; Eisenberger and Rhoades 2001)
are among its most well-known opponents. Their research suggests that performance-
contingent reward and high reward expectancy (i.e., employees’ belief that they would
get higher pay if they perform well) actually increase, rather than decrease, the sense of
self-determination and intrinsic motivation. This line of research (e.g., Eisenberger and
Rhoades 2001) also shows that performance-contingent reward actually increases
creativity among employees.

"The key argument provided by Eisenberger and his colleagues is that
performance-contingent reward is not controlling; rather it increases the sense of self-
determination."

"This is because the existence of performance-contingent reward conveys
to the employees two pieces of important information: “(a) the organization has little
control over the employee’s daily job performance beyond minimally acceptable levels,
and (b) the employee has the opportunity to choose whether to pursue the reward by
altering performance” (Eisenberger et al. 1999 p. 1028)"

## Rebutalls to challenge
"In other words, information asymmetry and outcome uncertainty/controllability
may well result in both high level of perceived self-determination at work and high level
of performance-reward contingency"

# Interventions
Specific initiatives that have been found to successfully facilitate individuals’
internalization process fall into three categories: (1) acknowledging individual’s feelings
and perspectives (Deci et al. 1989; Deci et al. 1994), (2) providing choices (Deci et al.
1994), letting individuals take initiatives to make decisions and solve problems relevant
to themselves (Deci et al. 1989;), or involving them in important decision making that
affects the organization (Lynch et al. 2005), (3) good communication (Gagné, et al.
2000), including providing meaningful rationales (Deci et al. 1994) and positive feedback
(Deci et al. 1989).

Therefore, at a less
instrumental level, it appears that when individual’s feelings and perspectives are
acknowledged, i.e., when their “voice” is heard, the need for relatedness is better
satisfied.


"providing meaningful rationales for certain behavior also facilitates the internalization of
motivation to engage in such behavior thereby increasing autonomous motivation (Deci
et al. 1994; Reeve, Jang, Harde, and Omura 2002). This is because providing individuals
with information about the value or importance of such behavior aids individuals to
endorse this behavior and further incorporate it in their value systems (Deci and Ryan
2000)."

# Importance to relevance of work to strategic outcomes

"In order to foster employees’ autonomous motivation to work, organizations need
to ensure that employees understand not only the organization’s objectives but also how
their effort can contribute to the ultimate attainment of those objectives."

"Compared with traditional performance measurement systems, SPMS appears to
be more effective in communicating business objectives to employees."

# Role Orientations of Employees

"Role orientation is one type of work orientation, which is a belief system
construed by employees about their work roles and work environment (Parker, Wall, and
Jackson 1997)."

Two types of work orientations
- Strategic orientation is employees’ understanding, endorsement and internalization of the
organizations’ strategic objectives.

- It is possible for strategic orientation to misalign with the roles within the company
- A more autonomous work environment is better at coping with this realignment


# Self-serving attribute bias
"the tendency to make greater attribution to personal factors for success than for failure (Ross
and Fletcher 1985; Pyszczynsk and Greeberg 1987).

In other words, individuals tend to
take too much credit for superior performance and refute responsibility for poor
performance.

"In general, evidence supports the proposition that self-serving attribution is
mainly driven by the desire to protect one’s self-image (Pyszczynski, and Solomon 1982;
Greenberg 1991; Greenberg, Ditto and Lopez 1992)"

'Interestingly, Knee and Zuckerman (1996) find that individuals who are high in
autonomy causality orientation and low in control causality orientation are not vulnerable
to self-serving attributional bias. This result can be explained by an earlier finding that
those individuals tend to view unsolved problems as challenges to be mastered rather
than threats to their competence, i.e., they are to a lesser degree ego-involved (Koestner
and Zuckerman 1994). As a result, those individuals may feel a lesser need to make
biased attribution in order to protect their self-images."

# Proactive Work Behaviors

 Similarly, Parker and Collins (2006) include two elements in the
definition of proactive work behavior: anticipation and taking control.

Other than
anticipation and taking control, other elements such as persistence when encountering
obstacles are also included in the conceptualization of proactive behaviors (Frese and Fay
2001; Parker and Collins 2006)

Examples for proactive work behavior include
anticipating and preventing problems before they occur, flexibly adapting to new market
conditions (Parker, Wall, and Jackson 1997) and generating and implementing new ideas
(Parker, Williams and Turner 2006).

In
other words, employees engage in work behaviors proactively only when they feel
volition and a sense of choice, and do not feel controlled by external forces.

# Job Satisfaction
"Judge, Thoresen, Bono, and Patton’s (2001) meta-analysis of 312 studies suggests
that overall job satisfaction is moderately associated with job performance (r = 0.30),
with the strongest moderator being task complexity. In other words, the more complex
the task is, the stronger the positive relationship is between job satisfaction and job
performance. Therefore, even if only the instrumentality of job satisfaction was
considered, examining how PMS characteristics impact employees’ job satisfaction is
valuable."

# Adaptable Choice vs Free Choice

# Relatedness
- the desire to feel connected to others

"Those interested in
SDT consider choice important to motivation (Deci and Ryan 1985, Ryan and
Deci, 2000; Deci and Ryan 2000; Gagné 2003), and they tend to characterize it
in one of three ways—no choice, controlled choice, and autonomous choice."

" A discussion linking SDT and its role in children’s play
appears long overdue, particularly when we consider that the widely accepted
definition of play as a freely chosen activity directly affects some policies and
practices related to play."

"Both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland’s play policies offi-
cially define play as “freely chosen, intrinsically motivated and with no external
goals”"

# Definition of PLay
Bergen (1988) developed a definition for school activities
based on the amount of choice, possibility, and opportunity children enjoy.
When children enjoyed the greatest degree of choice, she termed the activity
free play. As the level of choice moved from child to adult, the terms c

How much choice children have in their lives clearly has important con-
sequences for children in their play, which relates to the three psychological
tenets of SDT (again: autonomy, relatedness, and competence)


# LEGAULT - SDT
However, SDT also asserts that this natural
growth tendency should not be assumed and that
people can become controlled, fragmented, and
alienated if their basic psychological needs for
autonomy, competence, and relatedness are
undermined by a deficient social environment

 SDT rests on the notion that the
individual is involved continuously in a dynamic
interaction with the social world – at once striving
for need satisfaction and also responding to the
conditions of the environment that either support
or thwart needs. As a consequence of this person-
environment interplay, people become either
engaged, curious, connected, and whole, or
demotivated, ineffective, and detached.

"theoryis the idea of basic psychological needs; all
individuals strive for and need autonomy (the
need to feel free and self-directed), competence
(the need to feel effective), and relatedness (the
need to connect closely with others) in order to
flourish and grow."

# Intrinsic Motivation
 Intrinsic motivation is noninstrumental
innature;when intrinsicallymotivated,people are
notconcernedwithwhatoutcomewillbereceived
or avoided by engaging in the action.  Rather, they
perform the behavior because it is inherently sat-
isfying in and of itself.

"In contrast, extrinsic moti-
vation is fundamentally instrumental. People are
extrinsically motivated when they are concerned
with performing an action because of the conse-
quence associated with it; behavior is contingent"

# Cognitive Evaluation Theory
In sum, CET asserts that the context – includ-
ing external forces (e.g., deadlines), interpersonal
climates (e.g., praise, instruction), and internal
events (e.g., being ego-involved) – affects intrin-
sicmotivation as a function of thedegree to which
they are informational vs. controlling.

# Organismic Integration Theory (OIT)
OIT addresses the process by
which individuals acquire the motivation to carry
out behaviors that are not intrinsically interesting
or enjoyable

These subtypes of
extrinsic motivation are seen as falling along a
continuum of internalization (see Fig. 1). Thus,
whereas some extrinsic motivators are completely
external and nonself-determined, others can
be highly internal and self-determined (i.e.,
autonomous).

 The more a behavior or reg-
ulation is internalized, the more it becomes inte-
grated with the self and serves as a foundation for
self-determined motivation.

 OIT suggests that
regulation of behavior can become increasingly
internalized to the extent that the individual feels
autonomous and competent in effecting
it. Relatedness plays an important role in internal-
ization. That is, individuals will tend to initially
internalize behaviors that are valued by close
others.

Example
For example, if a child learns that her
father, whom she admires, strongly values and
cares about brushing his teeth, then she may be
apt to internalize the same behavior.

To integrate the
regulation of a behavior, people must understand
its personal significance and coordinate it with
their needs, values, and other behaviors

The degree to which any given behavior is
internalized is critically important to successful
performance and persistence of that behavior.
For instance, autonomously motivated students
study harder, pay more attention in class, and get
better grades (Vansteenkiste et al. 2004). In the
health regulationdomain,autonomous motivation
leads tosuperior self-regulationinweightloss and
weight loss maintenance (Teixeira et al. 2010), as
well as in smoking cessation (Williams et al.
2009). Autonomous forms of motivation also
play an important role in long-term persistence
in sports (Pelletier et al. 2001) and the self-control
of prejudiced responses (Legault et al. 2007).

The autonomy orientation is associated posi-
tively with self-esteem and self-actualization
(Deci and Ryan 1985), as well as greater daily
well-being, satisfaction of basic psychological
needs, autonomous engagement in daily activi-
ties, and positive daily social interactions
(Weinstein et al. 2012). In contrast, having a con-
trolled orientation is associated with self-
consciousness and proneness to feeling outwardly
evaluated and pressured (Deci and Ryan 1985),
as well as greater interpersonal defensiveness

The impersonal orientation
has been shown to be associated with self-
derogation, depression, and anxiety (Deci and
Ryan 1985), as well as self-handicapping, poor
performance (Hodgins et al. 2006), and a
fragmented identity (Soenens et al. 2005)

" Intrinsic aspirations include close relation-
ships, personal growth, and community contribu-
tions. In contrast, extrinsic aspirations are geared
toward obtaining external validation and proof of
self-worth and instead focus on the pursuit of
goals such as financial success, popularity/fame,
and image/appearance. "

"A second major proposition within RMTrefers
to the notion that the more people are autono-
mously motivated to be in relationships, the
more they will experience the relationship to be
fulfilling. Thus, when people enter and persist at
relationships for personal, autonomous reasons
(e.g., because they feel that the relationship is
important and meaningful) rather than controlled
reasons(e.g.,becausetheyfeel liketheyshouldbe
intherelationship), theyshow greaterrelationship
satisfaction, better daily relationship functioning,"

"Interestingly, the important role of auton-
omous motivation extends to relationships with
social groups; when individuals feel autono-
mously motivated to be part of a group (e.g.,
being Black, being German, being Catholic,
being part of a team or organization), they expe-
rience more positive group identity (Amiot and
Sansfaçon 2011)."

# PATRICK et al (2013) - Self-determination Theory and Implications for Parenting

## Permissive parenting
Permissive parenting involves allowing children to make many decisions for themselves, setting few
rules or boundaries, and aligning with children more as ‘friend’ than as a parental ‘authority’
figure. 

- Thus, social and cultural norms have the potential to shape the legitimacy of parental authority

## Autonomy Support
- Elicit the person’s (child’s) perspective, emotions.
- Provide a menu of options from which to choose.
- Provide rationale for advice given.
- Minimize control/avoid judgment.

## Competence Support
- Be positive about potential for success.
- Identify barriers.
- Skills building/problem solving.
- Create an appropriate level of challenge.

## Relatedness Support
- Develop a warm, positive relationship.
- Provide unconditional positive regard.
- Be empathic with the person’s (child’s) concerns, etc.

# Difference between neglectful parenting and SDT
Some confusion has arisen when SDT autonomy is made synonymous with independence. Thus, some have described
autonomy-support as lacking structure, boundaries, or guidance. This is, in fact, closer to
permissive or neglectful/uninvolved parenting.

# - RYAN & DECI (2000) - Intrinsic & Extrinsic Motivations Classic Definitions and New Directions
To be motivated means to be moved to do something

# Intrinsic Motivation
 When intrinsically
motivated a person is moved to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather
than because of external prods, pressures, or rewards

# Ways of measuring intrinsic motivation'
Basic
experimental research (e.g., Deci, 1971) has rested primarily on a behavioral
measure of intrinsic motivation called the ‘‘free choice’’ measure. In experi-
ments using this measure participants are exposed to a task under varying
conditions (e.g., getting a reward or not). Following this period, the experi-
menter tells participants they will not be asked to work with the target task
any further, and they are then left alone in the experimental room with the
target task as well as various distractor activities

They thus have a period
of ‘‘free choice’’ about whether to return to the activity, and it is assumed
that, if there is no extrinsic reason to do the task (e.g., no reward and no
approval), then the more time they spend with the target task


The other common approach to the measurement of intrinsic motivation
is the use of self-reports of interest and enjoyment of the activity per se.

# Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET) Summary
Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET) was presented by Deci and Ryan
(1985) to specify the factors in social contexts that produce variability in
intrinsic motivation.

CET, which is considered a subtheory of self-determina-
tion theory, argues that interpersonal events and structures (e.g., rewards,
communications, feedback) that conduce toward feelings of competence dur-
ing action can enhance intrinsic motivation for that action because they allow
satisfaction of the basic psychological need for competence. Accordingly,
for example, optimal challenges, effectance promoting feedback, and free-
dom from demeaning evaluations are all predicted to facilitate intrinsic moti-
vation.

# Examples of things boosting competence
- Optimal challenges
- Effectance promoting feedback
- positive feedback
- freedom from demeaning evaluations

# Autonomy boosters
- choice
- self-direction

# Negative effects
- rewards
- threats
- deadlines
- directives
- competition pressure


. On the other
hand, choice and the opportunity for self-direction (e.g., Zuckerman, Porac,
Lathin, Smith, & Deci, 1978) appear to enhance intrinsic motivation, as they
afford a greater sense of autonomy.

CET further specifies that feelings of competence will not enhance intrin-
sic motivation unless they are accompanied by a sense of autonomy or, in
attributional terms, by an internal perceived locus of causality (IPLOC; de-
Charms, 1968)

Several earlystudies showed thatpositive performancefeedback enhanced
intrinsic motivation (e.g., Deci, 1971; Harackiewicz, 1979), whereas nega-
tive performance feedback diminished it (e.g., Deci & Cascio, 1972). Others
(e.g., Vallerand & Reid, 1984) showed that perceived competence mediated
these effects, and still others supported the hypothesis that increases in per-
ceived competence must be accompanied by a sense of autonomy in order
for the enhanced feelings of competence to result in increased intrinsic moti-
vation (Ryan, 1982).

The research began with the demonstration that extrinsic re-
wards can undermine intrinsic motivation (Deci, 1971; Lepper, Greene, &
Nisbett, 1973), which we interpret in terms of the reward shifting people
from a more internal to external perceived locus of causality

 Furthermore, not only tangible rewards, but also threats
(Deci & Cascio, 1972), deadlines (Amabile, DeJong, & Lepper, 1976), direc-
tives (Koestner, Ryan, Bernieri, & Holt, 1984), and competition pressure
(Reeve & Deci, 1996) diminish intrinsic motivation because, according to
CET, people experience them as controllers of their behavior.

Students who are overly controlled not only lose initiative but also learn less well, especially when learning is com-
plex or requires conceptual, creative processing (Benware & Deci, 1984;
Grolnick & Ryan, 1987). Similarly, studies show children of parents who
are more autonomy supportive to be more mastery oriented—more likely to
spontaneously explore and extend themselves—than children of parents who
are more controlling (Grolnick, Deci, & Ryan, 1997).

# Intrinsic Appeal
However, it is critical to remember that intrinsic motivation will occur only for activities
that hold intrinsic interest for an individual—those that have the appeal of novelty, challenge, or aesthetic value for that individual. For activities that
do not hold such appeal, the principles of CET do not apply.

# Extrinsic Motivation
Although intrinsic motivation is clearly an important type of motivation,
most of the activities people do are not, strictly speaking, intrinsically moti-
vated. This is especially the case after early childhood, as the freedom to be
intrinsically motivated becomes increasingly curtailed by social demands
and rolesthatrequire individualsto assumeresponsibilityfornonintrinsically
interesting tasks. In schools, for example, it appears that intrinsic motivation
becomes weaker with each advancing grade.

# Amotivation
 When amotivated, a person’s behavior lacks intentionality and a sense
of personal causation. Amotivation results from not valuing an activity
(Ryan, 1995), not feeling competent to do it (Deci, 1975), or not believing
it will yield a desired outcome (Seligman, 1975).

# External Regulation
 Individuals typically experience
externally regulated behavior as controlled or alienated, and their actions
have an external perceived locus of causality (EPLOC; deCharms, 1968).
External regulation is the only kind of motivation recognized by operant
theorists (e.g., Skinner, 1953), and it is this type of extrinsic motivation that
was typically contrasted with intrinsic motivation in early lab studies and
discussions.

# Introjected Regulation
A second type of extrinsic motivation is introjected regulation. Introjec-
tion describes a type of internal regulation that is still quite controlling be-
cause people perform such actions with the feeling of pressure in order to
avoid guilt or anxiety or to attain ego-enhancements or pride.

# Identified Regulation
Here, the person has identified with the
personal importance of a behavior and has thus accepted its regulation as
his or her own. A boy who memorizes spelling lists because he sees it as
relevant to writing, which he values as a life goal, has identified with the
value of this learning activity.

# Integrated Regulation
This occurs through self-examination and bringing new regulations into congruence with one’s other values and needs. The
more one internalizes the reasons for an action and assimilates them to the
self, the more one’s extrinsically motivated actions become self-determined.

This place-
ment emphasizes that intrinsic motivation is a prototype of self-determined
activity. Yet, as implied above, this does not mean that as extrinsic regula-
tions become more internalized they are transformed into intrinsic motiva-
tion.

# Don't uise this as a developmental continuum
The process of internalization is developmentally important, as social val-
ues and regulations are continually being internalized over the life span. Still,
we do not suggest that the continuum underlying types of extrinsic motiva-
tion is a developmental continuum, per se

indeed, one can initially adopt a new behavioral regulation at any point along
this continuum depending upon prior experiences and situational factors
(Ryan, 1995)

 Thus, while there are predictable reasons for
movement between orientations, there is no necessary ‘‘sequence.’’ Devel-
opmental issues are, however, evident in two ways: (1)the typesof behaviors
and values that can be assimilated to the self increase with growing cognitive
and ego capacities and (2) it appears that people’s general regulatory style
does, on average, tend to become more ‘‘internal’’ over time (e.g., Chan-
dler & Connell, 1987), in accord with the general organismic tendencies
toward autonomy and self-regulation (Ryan, 1995).

# STart with relatedness
Because extrinsically motivated behaviors are not inherently interesting
and thus must initially be externally prompted, the primary reason people
are likely to be willing to do the behaviors is that they are valued by signifi-
cant others to whom they feel (or would like to feel) connected, whether
that be a family, a peer group, or a society. This suggests that the groundwork
for facilitating internalization is providing a sense of belongingness and con-
nectedness to the persons, group, or culture disseminating a goal, or what
in SDT wecall asense of relatedness.

"In classroomsthismeans thatstudents’
feeling respectedand cared forby the teacher is essentialfor their willingness
to accept the proffered classroom values. In support of this, Ryan, Stiller,
and Lynch(1994) found that relatedness to teachers(and parents) wasassoci-
ated with greater internalization of school-related behavioral regulations."

"A second issue concerns perceived competence. Adopting as one’s own
an extrinsic goal requires that one feel efficacious with respect to it. Students
will more likely adopt and internalize a goal if they understand it and have
the relevant skills to succeed at it. Thus, we theorize that supports for compe-
tence (e.g., offering optimal challenges and effectance-relevant feedback)
facilitate internalization."

To fully internalize a regulation, and thus to become autonomous with re-
spect to it, people must inwardly grasp its meaning and worth.

# Experiments with 
- Meaningful Rationale

Again, research has supported this reasoning. Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, and
Leone (1994) experimentally demonstrated that providing a meaningful ra-
tionale for an uninteresting behavior, along with supports for autonomy and
relatedness, promoted internalization and integration.

Again, research has supported this reasoning. Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, and
Leone (1994) experimentally demonstrated that providing a meaningful ra-
tionale for an uninteresting behavior, along with supports for autonomy and
relatedness, promoted internalization and integration. Controlling contexts
yielded less overall internalization, but even more interesting, the internaliza-
tion that did occur in controlling contexts tended to be only introjected.

 Grolnick and Ryan (1989) found higher
levels of internalization and integration of school-related values among chil-
INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC MOTIVATIONS 65
dren whose parents were more supportive of autonomy and relatedness. Wil-
liams and Deci (1996) used a longitudinal design to show greater internaliza-
tion among medical students whose instructors were more autonomy and
competence supportive.


# RYAN & DECI (2000) - Self-Determination Theory and the Facilitation of Intrinsic Motivation, Social Development, and Well-Being

Cognitive evaluation theory (CET) was presented by
Deci and Ryan (1985) as a subtheory within SDT that had
the aim of specifying factors that explain variability in
intrinsic motivation.

"Also, research revealed that not only tangible rewards
but also threats, deadlines, directives, pressured evalua-
tions, and imposed goals diminish intrinsic motivation be-
cause, like tangible rewards, they conduce toward an ex-
ternal perceived locus of causality."

"In contrast, choice,
acknowledgment of feelings, and opportunities for self-
direction were found to enhance intrinsic motivation be-
cause they allow people a greater feeling of autonomy
(Deci & Ryan, 1985)."

# Relatedness
Although autonomy and competence supports are
highly salient for producing variability in intrinsic motiva-
tion, a third factor, relatedness, also bears on its expression.
In infancy, intrinsic motivation is readily observable as
exploratory behavior and, as suggested by attachment the-
orists (e.g., Bowlby, 1979), it is more evident when the
infant is securely attached to a parent. Studies of mothers
and infants have, indeed, shown that both security and
maternal autonomy support predict more exploratory be-
havior in the infants (e.g., Frodi, Bridges, & Grolnick,
1985).

SDT hypothesizes that a similar dynamic occurs in
interpersonal settings over the life span, with intrinsic
motivation more likely to flourish in contexts characterized
by a sense of security and relatedness. For example, Ander-
son, Manoogian, and Reznick (1976) found that when
children worked on an interesting task in the presence of an
adult stranger who ignored them and failed to respond to
their initiations, a very low level of intrinsic motivation
resulted, and Ryan and Grolnick (1986) observed lower
intrinsic motivation in students who experienced their
teachers as cold and uncaring. 


# Self-Regulation of Extrinsic Motivation

Whenever
a person (be it a parent, teacher, boss, coach, or therapist)
attempts to foster certain behaviors in others, the others'
motivation for the behavior can range from amotivation or
unwillingness, to passive compliance, to active personal
commitment. According to SDT, these different motiva-
tions reflect differing degrees to which the value and reg-
ulation of the requested behavior have been internalized
and integrated. Internalization refers to people's "taking in"
a value or regulation, and integration refers to the further
transformation of that regulation into their own so that,
subsequently, it will emanate from their sense of self.

# Amotivation
At the far left of the self-determination continuum is
amotivation, the state of lacking the intention to act. When
amotivated, people either do not act at all or act without
intent--they just go through the motions. Amotivation re-
sults from not valuing an activity (Ryan, 1995), not feeling
competent to do it (Bandura, 1986), or not expecting it to
yield a desired outcome (Seligman, 1975)

# Introjected
"A second type of extrinsic motivation is labeled in-
trojected regulation. Introjection involves taking in a reg-
ulation but not fully accepting it as one's own. It is a
relatively controlled form of regulation in which behaviors
are performed to avoid guilt or anxiety or to attain ego
enhancements such as pride. Put differently, introjection
represents regulation by contingent self-esteem (Deci &
Ryan, 1995)."

"A classic form of introjection is ego involve-
ment (deCharms, 1968; Nicholls, 1984; Ryan, 1982), in
which people are motivated to demonstrate ability (or avoid
failure) in order to maintain feelings of worth. "

"Although
internally driven, introjected behaviors still have an exter-
nal perceived locus of causality and are not really experi-
enced as part of the self."

# Identified
"A more autonomous, or self-determined, form of ex-
trinsic motivation is regulation through identification.
Identification reflects a conscious valuing of a behavioral
goal or regulation, such that the action is accepted or
owned as personally important. Finally, the most autono-"


# Not a developmental continuum

This process may occur in stages, over time, but we are not
suggesting that it is a developmental continuum in the
sense that people must progress through each stage of
internalization with respect to a particular regulation.
Rather, they can relatively readily internalize a new behav-
ioral regulation at any point along this continuum depend-
ing on both prior experiences and current situational factors
(Ryan, 1995).

# Facilitating Integration of Extrinsic Motivation
Given the significance of internalization for personal expe-
rience and behavioral outcomes, the critical issue becomes
how to promote autonomous regulation for extrinsically
motiwtted behaviors. That is, what are the social conditions
that nurture versus inhibit internalization and integration?

This suggests that
relatedness, the need to feel belongingess and connected-
ness with others, is centrally important for internalization.

# Autonomy Definition

But, within SDT, autonomy
refers not to being independent, detached, or selfish but
rather to the feeling of volition that can accompany any act,
whether dependent or independent, collectivist or individ-
ualist, 

"By definition, intrinsically motivated behaviors, the
prototype of self-determined actions, stem from the self.
They are unalienated and authentic in the fullest sense of
those terms."

# Inauthenticity as a failure of internationalization
It is the flip side of this coin, however, that speaks
directly to the issues of alienation and inauthenticity and is
relevant to such questions as why employees show no
initiative, why teenagers reject their schools' values, and
why patients adhere so poorly to treatment. SDT under-
stands such occurrences in terms of the undermining of
intrinsic motivation and, perhaps even more typically, the
failure of internalization. 

We have thus proposed that the basic needs
for competence, autonomy, and relatedness must be satisfled across the life span for an individual to experience an
ongoing sense of integrity and well-being or "eudaimonia"
(Ryan & Frederick, 1997; Waterman, 1993)

# Life goals and satisfaction of needs
For example, exposure to the commercial media can
prompt a locus on materialism (Richins, 1987), which
provides only fleeting satisfactions and could actually de-
tract from basic need fulfillment and, thus, well-being.
Prior deficits in need fulfillment (e.g., from poor caregiv-
ing) might also lead individuals to yearn for more extrinsic
goals as a substitute or compensatory mechanism.

"In fact,
T. Kasser, Ryan, Zax, and Sameroff (1995) found that teens
who had been exposed to cold, controlling maternal care
(as assessed with ratings by the teens, mothers, and observ-
ers) were more likely to develop materialistic orientations,compared with better nurtured teens who more strongly
valued the intrinsic goals of personal growth, relationships,
and community. 

"In short, cultural and developmental in-
fluences produce variations in the importance of goals, the
pursuit of which, in turn, yields different satisfaction of
basic needs and different levels of well-being."

"Debates concerning the activity or passivity, responsibility
or indolence, of human beings have been perennial (Kohn,
1990).

"Excessive control, nonoptimal chal-
lenges, and lack of connectedness, on the other hand,
disrupt the inherent actualizing and organizational tenden-
cies endowed by nature, and thus such factors result not
only in the lack of initiative and responsibility but also in
distress and psychopathology.
o

# Intrinsic Motivations in Primates
As humanistic as these formulations might sound, these active tendencies of intrinsic
motivation and integration in development are by no means uniquely human. The early
experiments on intrinsic motivation, for example, were done with primates (Harlow,
1950), and one can observe both intrinsic motivation and dependence on psychological
needs in primates and other mammalian species (de Waal, 2009; Waller, 1998). Primates
have built-in intrinsic motivations upon which their development substantially depends.

"Psychological mediators reign. It is, for example, the perception of being controlled
that undermines a worker’s initiative; the felt rejection implied by an insult that gives
rise to withdrawal or aggression; the experience of mastery that gratifies and sustains
an effort."

# Anti-social behaviour
 Nonetheless, with equal readiness one can observe the human capacities
to be apathetic and alienated, to disconnect from and dehumanize others, and to behave
in ways that imply fragmentation and inner division rather than integration. These seem-
ingly contradictory human natures, with capacities for activity and passivity, integrity
and fragmentation, caring and cruelty, can be theoretically approached in different ways.

# Experience dependant
According to SDT, therefore, our manifest human nature is, to a large
degree, experience dependent—its forms of expression are contingent on the conditions
of support versus thwarting and satisfaction versus frustration of these basic needs. SDT
places human beings, with their active, integrative tendencies, in dialectical relation with
ambient social contexts that can either support or thwart those tendencies.


# ON Competance
" The need for
competence is evident as an inherent striving, manifested in curiosity, manipulation, and
a wide range of epistemic motives (Deci & Moller, 2005). It energizes myriad behaviors,
from people in leisure moments playing mobile video games to scientists discovering the
laws of the universe. Competence is, however, readily thwarted. It wanes in contexts in
which challenges are too difficult, negative feedback is pervasive, or feelings of mastery
and effectiveness are diminished or undermined by interpersonal factors such as person-
focused criticism and social comparisons."

# On Relatedness
Relatedness (Bowlby, 1979; Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Ryan, 1995) concerns feel-
ing socially connected.
People feel relatedness most typically when they feel cared for
by others. Yet relatedness is also about belonging and feeling significant among others.

# Perfectionism
 Perfectionism, for exam-
ple, can be a battle for love via competence, yet accompanied by a loss of autonomy.

# Other Motivation Theories
Expectancy– valence theories (e.g., Feather, 1990; Vroom, 1964) predict behaviors and
attitudes from the amount of motivation, which is said to result from the valence or psy-
chological value of outcomes multiplied by the probability of being able to attain those
outcomes.

Similarly, cognitive- behavioral theories predict motivation from the strength
of one’s beliefs about being able to achieve outcomes (Rotter, 1954; Seligman, 1975) or,
in a somewhat more differentiated formulation, one’s contingency and efficacy expecta-
tions (Bandura, 1977, 1996)

# autonomy– control continuum
For instance, one can stimulate external regulation by using controlling
reward contingencies (see Deci, Koestner & Ryan, 1999); stimulate introjection by foster-
ing ego involvement and contingent self- esteem (e.g., Roth, 2008; Ryan, 1982); promote
identification by providing convincing rationales for acting (e.g., Reeve, Jang, Hardre,
& Omura, 2002); facilitate integrated regulation with a combination of acknowledging
feelings, providing a rationale, and highlighting choice instead of control (Deci, Eghrari,
Patrick, & Leone, 1994); or incite intrinsic motivation by affording people interesting
and optimally challenging tasks (e.g., Danner & Lonky, 1981; Grolnick & Ryan, 1987).

 Indeed, the internalization of socially
transmitted regulations, goals, and values is largely based in the desire to connect with
relevant groups (e.g., family, peer groups, or society)

# Cultural influences on motivation
SDT predicts that people within different religions and cultures internalize ambient
norms, rules, and values to varied degrees. Some religious practices (e.g., Ryan, Rigby, &
King, 1993) and cultural norms (e.g., Chirkov, Ryan, Kim, & Kaplan, 2003) are exter-
nally regulated and/or introjected; others are more fully internalized and integrated.

# Virtual Worlds
Although SDT is a real-world theory in the sense of having applications to everyday
life, it is also applicable to media and virtual worlds and people’s participation in them
(Rigby & Ryan, 2011). SDT explains how factors within media and game worlds enhance
or detract from intrinsic motivation to watch or play (e.g., Ryan, Rigby & Przybylski,
2006) and how the role of elements such as violence can be related to the dynamics of
psychological need satisfaction (Przybylski, Rigby, & Ryan, 2010; Przybylski, Ryan, &
Rigby, 2009). Virtual worlds are increasingly a part of people’s experiential lives in our
technological age, and thus we discuss in depth the example of motivation in video games
as illustrative of the issues involved in this emerging domain of studies (Chapter 20).
