- Quantitative
- individual productivity
- personal productivity

# Who should read this
- Anyone planning on improving their individual productivity, reducing procrastination, etc  

# Why measure your productivity?
- Accountability
- Monitors performance and provides feedback - Check progress towards an objective
- Diagnose problems, identify trends, etc. permits early adjustment and corrective action, 
- Facilitate planning - Using information you can determine what changes should be made

Importance of having a PDCA loop
PDCA
- Deming cycle
- Shewhart cycle
- Used in Kaizen

How do I measure productivity?
- Determining the Unit of Output
- Determining the unit of input

- Time spent doing productive things
- Leading indicator
- Easily measurable
- Easy to compare

The problem with measuring productivity by completion of tasks

"For most jobs, however, problems of combining dissimilar outputs and identifying intangible outputs arise."
- Non uniform outcomes
- Lagging indicator
- Doesn't work for tasks of high complexity
   - Finding a proof for a Maths problem
- Hard to compare across large time frames
   
- "Manual work by assemblers, for instance, is easier to measure than the tangible and intangible value of engineers. Processes in manufacturing repeat and are predictable."

- "Knowledge jobs involve more complex tasks with many variables."

Criticisms
  - Quality vs quantity
  
Strategies for improvement
- Gradually reduce unproductive activities 
- Pomodoro technique
- Gym progression strategy
- Biohacking
   - Sleeping well
   - Drugs
   - 
- Psychological hacking
   - integrated motivation
   - intrinsic motivation
   - extrinsic motivation
- Self development theory
- motivational interviewing

Avoid burnout

Keep a balance between work and your health 
- Remember to sleep well

Planning
-  Identifying areas of improvement

Doing
- Monitoring your work day / week

Checking
- Regular review

Adjust
- Did the change work?
- Did it not work?
- Asking why


With that in mind, we should put measurement in its proper place - as a tool for gauging whether the changes we make are effective.

Definitions of productivity
- Productivity  = Outputs / Inputs

- Match productivity improvements efforts to spending 
- Daily updates

Most productivity measures are designed for companies and governments. It is not that relevant for the individual aiming for self-improvement
"Productivity is one of the main concerns of business management and engineering"

- Measuring Time Management Productivity
- The time management method determines employee productivity by recording how they use their work time
"Accurate measurement will reveal how much time is spent on accomplishing work duties in a timely way, as well as how much time is lost to illness or excessive time off, non-work-related conversations, and distractions such as texting and social media."


"iDoneThis is a software that sends an email to each employee at the end of every workday. Each employee then replies to the email, stating what they've accomplished that day. The next morning, everyone on that team receives a list of team accomplishments. Each person's productivity is tracked in a public way, keeping them accountable and ensuring that the weight of a project is pulled evenly."

"She believes that because personal and professional lives are increasingly blending and overlapping, it's most accurate to base productivity measurements on completion of tasks, "not minutes spent at the office." "

- "Manual work by assemblers, for instance, is easier to measure than the tangible and intangible value of engineers. Processes in manufacturing repeat and are predictable."

- "Knowledge jobs involve more complex tasks with many variables."

- "asking employees for updates at the end of the day can serve as a motivator. When employees know accountability is expected, they are more likely to stay on pace with goals."


Organizational Linkages: Understanding the Productivity Paradox (1994)
Chapter: 5 MEASURING AND MANAGING INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVITY

William A. Ruch

- On why productivity isn't measured
"Part of the problem may lie in the unit of analysis industry uses to measure productivity and in a failure to recognize the complexity of the relationships between the productivity of the individual worker and the total performance of the organization"

" Organizational studies generally focus on the total performance of the organization, but even those that are centered on organizational productivity rarely attempt to disaggregate findings to the business unit, work group, or individual level in any systematic way."

5 functions of individual level productivity
1. Defines productivity and direct behaviour. The measurement system provides an implicit definition of productivity
2. Monitor performance and provide feedback. Check progress towards an objective
3. Diagnose problems. identify trends, problems, and permits early adjustment and corrective action. "Like any other indicator, productivity measurements do not necessarily identify the source of the problem, only that one exists."

4. Facilitate planning and control. Measurements provide information on time usage, which can help determine what changes should be made

5. Support innovation. Productivity data aids in evaluation of proposed changes to existing products or the introduction of new ones.

"If, however, the measures will be used as a basis for an employee evaluation system leading to bonuses, pay raises, layoffs, and disciplinary actions, inputs and outputs of the measures must be more precise and accurate for shorter time periods, and they must exclude factors outside the control of the worker"

"The fundamental question is not, what productivity measures should be used? The fundamental question is, what are the organizational objectives? "

- There is a linkage to what is being measured and the behavioural outcome
 - "Unfortunately, many organizational incentive systems are based on productivity or other performance measures that are not in line with organizational goals. Programmers, for example, may be measured and rewarded for lines of code written per hour. Accountants may be evaluated on the number of reports produced, and maintenance personnel on the number of routine equipment overhauls performed. In each instance (and many more), maximization of the measured criterion would likely be counterproductive to the organization."
 
"The Goal Alignment model suggests that individuals, groups, and business units are not goal driven, but measurement driven. The old saying that ''you get what is inspected, not what is expected" is relevant here.

### Conceptual Schematic Productivity model
developed by Ruch and Hershauer (1974)
Productivity is comprised of:
1. task capacity
2. individual capacity
3. individual effort
4. uncontrollable interferences

### The Productivity Servosystem Model
Hershauer and Ruch (1978)


### Determining the Unit of Output
"For most jobs, however, problems of combining dissimilar outputs and identifying intangible outputs arise."

"Programming operations, in an effort to get away from counting lines of code, have experimented with "function points" (i.e., number of functions performed within a program) as a measure of output"

## Determining the Unit of Input
- at the individual level of analysis the focus is generally on the labor component
- Labor can be measured in physical terms as hours worked
- hours at work 

### Productivity versus Quality
But many individual productivity measurement systems should be revised to account for defects that are produced but not detected until later in the process.

### Productivity versus Performance
"every employee has the opportunity to make contributions to the organization that may be recognized only by observation"

### Misuses of data
Other common misuses include using the results as a whip to speed the pace of work or to place blame on a worker for poor performance

Unfair comparisons, such as using the same measure under vastly different circumstances, can also cause problems.

"The concept of productivity is still often misunderstood; discussions of the relationship of productivity to effectiveness, efficiency, quality, innovation, and financial or behavioral measures of performance take the form of debates. A common definition of productivity, at all levels of organizational analysis, is a prerequisite for the development of a comprehensive measurement system."

"Attempts to aggregate individual productivity measures or to disaggregate organizational measures are thwarted by the dissimilarity in measures of output."


## Kaisen

"Kaizen methodology includes making changes and monitoring results, then adjusting"

PDCA
- Deming cycle
- Shewhart cycle

"and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the scientific method and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes"

# Root Cause Analysis
- 5 whys
   - "The key is to encourage the trouble-shooter to avoid assumptions and logic traps"
   - "This is one of the most important aspects in the five why approach â€“ the real root cause should point toward a process that is not working well or does not exist"
   
- Criticism of 5 whys
 - "Reasons for this criticism include:

    Tendency for investigators to stop at symptoms rather than going on to lower-level root causes.
    Inability to go beyond the investigator's current knowledge â€“ the investigator cannot find causes that they do not already know.
    Lack of support to help the investigator provide the right answer to "why" questions.
    Results are not repeatable â€“ different people using five whys come up with different causes for the same problem.
    Tendency to isolate a single root cause, whereas each question could elicit many different root causes."

Monitor time management
"This is the number one killer of productivity in the workplace. Time spent browsing the internet, playing games, checking email and making personal calls all contribute to lower productivity."

- Deep work time

- shallow work

# Quotes

''you get what is inspected, not what is expected"
As the management guru, Peter Druker puts it:

    If You Canâ€™t Measure It, You Canâ€™t Improve It.

"The advantage of tracking hours, [â€¦] is that many of the important but non-urgent projects I pursue cannot be forced. I can commit, for example, to finishing a proof in a week, but this doesnâ€™t mean I will succeed. Some proofs never come together; some take months (or years); others fall quickly. Itâ€™s hard to predict. "
- Cal Newport in Deep Work

"Tracking hours ensures, at the very least, that these projects are getting a good share of my time, even if I canâ€™t predict what will finish and when."
- Cal Newport
