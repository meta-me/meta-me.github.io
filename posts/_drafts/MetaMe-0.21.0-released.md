The much request Export to CSV feature has finally arrived in MetaMe 0.21.0.

## New Feature - Export to CSV
The Export to CSV feature lets you view and analyze your data in other applications like Excel.

Export to CSV gives granularity and time period options for you to choose. "Granularity" summarizes your time into units between 15 minutes to 1 day. "Time period" lets you limit the data exported. MetaMe gives you the option of exporting the entire history of your data.
