title: Identified Motivation 
---

# Identified Motivation

It involves consciously valuing a goal or regulation so that said action is accepted as personally important.
" involves
people identifying with the personal value and importance of
the behavior for themselves and thus accepting it as their own."
- "Still more autonomous is identified regulation, in which the individuals have personally identified with
the importance or value of their work roles and behaviors"

# Causes
   - Lack of relatedness support
   - Lack of autonomy support
   - Lack of competence support
   - Your goal is extrinsic in nature
   - Insufficient internalization of the goal or task
   - You haven't sufficiently internalized the goal 
   - You have a strong control orientation

# Remedies
- Increase relatedness
   - Change the friends you hang with
   - Join a community
   - Do the activity in a group
   - If its exercise or sport, Join a group
   - Perhaps get a personal trainer
   - Find supportive friends or family
   - Role of relatedness depends on the context
      - Academic, this is less important
      - Team sports, relatedness is much more important
   - Relatedness can play a major role in determining motivation, depending on the context
  
- Increase competence
   - Set small goals
   - Start easy
   - Have challenging but achievable goals

- Increase autonomy support
   - Be gentle to yourself

- Increase internalization
   - Daily affirmations
   - Strengthen your rationale 
   - Resolve conflicts

- Measurement
   - The old business management saying “What gets measured can be improved” might help you stay inspired.
- Prioritization
   - GTD
   - Eat the frog
   - 5min rule
   - Eisenhower matrix

- Optimization
   - Time management
      - Flowtime
      - Timeblocking
      - Pomodoro
      - deep work
   - Don't break the chain / X-mark technique / Seinfield method

- Focus on your “why”


# Goal Contents Theory
- Extrinsic goals such as financial success, appearance, and popularity/fame have been specifically contrasted with intrinsic goals such as community, close relationships, and personal growth, with the former more likely associated with lower wellness and greater ill-being.
- Three orientations
   - Autonomous Orientations: result from satisfaction of the basic needs
   - Strong controlled orientations: Result from satisfaction of competence and relatedness needs but not of autonomy and is linked to regulation through internal and external contingencies, which lead to rigid functioning and diminished well being.
   - Impersonal Orientations: Results from failing to fulfill all three needs. This is also related to poor functioning and ill being.

# Providing Rationales
- Hyungshim Jang
- Undergraduate students (N = 136; 108 women, 28 men) worked on a relatively uninteresting short lesson after either receiving or not receiving a rationale. Students who received the rationale showed greater interest, work ethic, and determination. 
- Models
    1. An identified regulation model based on self-determination theory
    2. An interest regulation model based on interest-enhancing strategies research
    3. An additive model that integrated both models.

## Extrinsic Goals?
- Conflicts? 
 Integration is very important because there is potential for
conflict among different identifications (e.g., an identification with one’s job and an identification with one’s family), so people need to bring them into coherence.

 When identifications have been
integrated, people are wholeheartedly engaged and purposive with respect to the target activities,
and without inner barriers or conflicts.

- Ryan, Stiller and Lynch[23] found that children internalize school's extrinsic regulations when they feel secure and cared for by parents and teachers. 
- Internalisation of extrinsic motivation is also linked to competence. OIT suggests that feelings of competence in activities should facilitate internalisation of said actions.[24]
- This was supported by Deci, Eghrari, Patrick and Leone[26] who found in laboratory settings if a person was given a meaningful reason for uninteresting behaviour along with support for their sense of autonomy and relatedness they internalized and integrated their behaviour. 
- COT 

2. the control orientation in which the focus is on rewards, gains, and approval; 

3. Relatedness Examples
Frodi, Bridges and Grolnick[30]
- "A comparison of the secure/stable and the insecure/stable groups, however, did suggest that the secure/stable group was superior to the insecure/stable groups on all mastery-related measures
2. Competence Examples
- Deci[27] found that giving people unexpected positive feedback on a task increases people's intrinsic motivation to do it, meaning that this was because the positive feedback was fulfilling people's need for competence
In fact, giving positive feedback on a task served only to increase people's intrinsic motivation and decreased extrinsic motivation for the task. 
- Vallerand and Reid[18] found negative feedback has the opposite effect (i.e., decreasing intrinsic motivation by taking away from people's need for competence). 

1. Autonomy Examples
- Research by Amabile, DeJong and Lepper[28] found other external factors like deadlines, which restrict and control, also decrease intrinsic motivation. 
- Deci[27] found that offering people extrinsic rewards for behaviour that is intrinsically motivated undermined the intrinsic motivation as they grow less interested in it. Initially intrinsically motivated behaviour becomes controlled by external rewards, which undermines their autonomy. 
- Situations that give autonomy as opposed to taking it away also have a similar link to motivation. Studies looking at choice have found that increasing a participant's options and choices increases their intrinsic motivation.[29]


## Compensating

### Tradeoffs
- Loss in self-determined motivation in one context (education) can lead a person to compensate in an other context (leisure)
- Hypothesis
   - Individuals work to restore their global motivation at a certain level.
- Study
   - Someone who did poorly in exam might compensate in another domain such as sport
   - "Losses in competence and self-determined motivation in one domain (school) seem to have motivated individuals to restore the sense of self, and consequently, to experience an increase in self-determined motivation toward the other context (sport).

- SDT, loss in self-determined motivation is replaced by less optimal ways of functional (external regulation, amotivation, etc)

- Whether three needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness are innate and universal is up for discussion
# Symptoms


# Treatment

   - Need further internalization of the extrinsic motivation
   - promote competence
   - promote autonomy
   - promote relatedness

- These subtypes of extrinsic motivation are seen as falling along a continuum of internalization
- OIT particularly highlights supports for autonomy and relatedness as critical to internalization.
- OIT proposes internalization is more likely to occur when there is a sense of relatedness. 
- If an external context allows a person to integrate regulation—they must feel competent, related and autonomous. They must also understand the regulation in terms of their other goals to facilitate a sense of autonomy.[25]

## Relatedness
## Different Roles of the Need for Relatedness
- Deci and Ryan
   - "role of relatedness is more distal"

- Hypothesis
   - Role of relatedness depends on the context
      - Academic, this is less important
      - Team sports, relatedness is much more important
   - Relatedness can play a major role in determining motivation, depending on the context

- Relatedness as value transmission
- "Value transmission refers to the beliefs and values held by certain individuals and groups that eventually become internalized by other individuals."

## Evidence
A meta-analysis of experiements showed that over 100 confirmed experiements of this

# Internalization

Ryan et al. (1985)
addressed that issue with the concept of internalization,
which had been an important concept in developmental
psychology for manyyears, and they suggested that people tend
to internalize material endorsed by significant others in order
to satisfy a basic psychological need for relatedness

"However, the researchers pointed out that internalization,
which is a natural part of the integrative process, may not
always function wholly effectively so motivations sometimes
get only partially internalized and thus not fully integrated."

" it became
clear that the distinction between autonomous and controlled
motivation was the most useful and appropriate as the primary
distinction in SDT"
