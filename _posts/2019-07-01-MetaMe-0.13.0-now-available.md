---

MetaMe 0.13.0 is now available. This version gives you more improved tooltips, an improved application selection screen, and a redesigned goal history widget.

### Improved Tooltips
Hovering over 15 minute bars now shows your top 5 most used applications for that period. This allows you to reconstruct your day in greater detail than before

### Improved application selection
The application selection screen now allows you to filter results by "applications" and "websites". This makes it easier to search for the item you had in mind

### Redesigned Goal History Widget
