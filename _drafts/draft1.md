title: Top x benefits of automatic time tracking 
---

There are many reasons why people track their time. From remembering the past, filling in timesheets to self-improvement. 

As our lives become more digital, it is becoming easier to track large parts of our lives automatically with software. Here are some of the top benefits of automatic time tracking.

## Look up the past
For most of us, our memories are unreliable for time tracking. This is particularly the case when your deep in work, or perhaps just surfing the web. 

Automatic time tracking lets you retrace your day accurately. Great for reconstructing your day, filling in timesheets, or satisfying your curiosity.

## Increased awareness of your daily habits 
By recording our digital habits over long periods it becomes easier to see patterns in the way we work.  We can measure exactly the time we spend working, social media or news each day. We can see when we are most productive, and least productive.

Being aware of your working style also allows you to optimize your day for productivity. Studying your most productive days and weeks, allows you to understand and potentially recreate conditions to maximize your productivity.

## Study your most productive days
Time tracking over longer periods allows you to capture characteristics of your most productive days and weeks. This information can serve as a baseline in understanding and potentially recreating conditions for you to increase and maximize your productivity.

## Encourages self-reflection
Awareness of your time usage typically leads to self-reflection. Self reflection is often accompanied by reevaluation of priorities, self-identity and goals.

## Trigger self-improvement
Increased awareness and reflection may also lead to behavioural change. 

## Conclusion
Hopefully I have shown that time tracking can be greatly helpful for not only people who procrastinate, but for all workers. This is particularly the case for digital workers who spend a majority of their time at their computers. Do you agree? Please leave a comment below
