Top x benefits of automatic time tracking

# Establish context
There are many reasons why people track their time. From remembering the past, filling in timesheets to self-improvement. 
As our lives become more digital, it is becoming easier to track large parts of our lives automatically. 

Here are some of the top benefits of automatic time tracking.

# Look up what happened in the past
Our memories are unreliable for time tracking. This is particularly the case when your deep in work, or perhaps just surfing the web. 
Automatic time tracking lets you retrace your day accurately. Great for reconstructing your day, filling in timesheets, or satisfying your curiosity.

# Increased awareness of your daily habits 
By recording our digital habits over long periods it becomes easier to see patterns in the way we work.  We can measure exactly the time we spend working, social media or news each day. We can see when we are most productive, and least productive.

Being aware of your working style also allows you to optimize your day for productivity. Studying your most productive days and weeks, allows you to understand and potentially recreate conditions to maximize your productivity.

# Increased awareness of your energy levels over time
Observing data over longer periods can also serve as a proxy for measuring your energy levels or discipline. Are you spending large amounts of time avoiding work? Perhaps you need a break. Is your productivity volatile? Perhaps you need to address your work life balance.

Your time spent everyday is a pretty good summary of your state. It serves as a constant monitor of your energy levels, motivation, your determination, and discipline. Having the ability to monitor your periods of motivation is a invaluable resource

# Encourages self-reflection
Awareness of your time usage typically leads to self-reflection. Self reflection is often accompanied by reevaluation of priorities, self-identity and goals.

# May trigger self-improvement
Increased awareness and reflection may also lead to behavioural change. 

# Conclusion
Hopefully I have shown that time tracking can be greatly helpful for not only people who procrastinate, but for all workers. This is particularly the case for digital workers who spend a majority of their time at their computers. Do you agree? Please leave a comment below

Our brains are not designed for accurate and precise time management. Having a tool accurately record our time usage 

we go through our day unaware of the details of how we spend. Tracking your time allows you to see the full truth of how you spend your time. What times do you work the most? What activities are you spending too much time on? Time tracking allows you to see these imbalances accurately without bias

Automatic time tracking can also reveal patterns in the way you work. Do you work best when your taking constant breaks pomodoro style, or can you focus on a single item for hours? Perhaps it is a combination of both. Being aware of your own limits and working style can allow you optimize your day and your productivity.

Time tracking typically brings up images of journals, diaries and timesheets. 

The idea of self-recording probably brings up images of diaries, 

The idea of self-recording doesn't exactly have the broadest appeal for most. 

It has never been easier to accurately track the way you use your computer. 

It has never been easier to accurately track the way you spend your day. Whether you want to use a dairy, a spreadsheet, or more sophisticated software tools, there are myriad products dedicated to the task.

Time tracking these days 

As a serial procrastinator, I understand the appeal of doing things later. It is so easy to be distracted by that clickbait link. Your brain would spontaneously trigger the need to check social media or news sites to make sure you don't miss out. Repeated satiations of your urges slowly morph into daily habits and become a part of your daily ritual 

It was after doing absolutely no work done for several months where I finally decided to do something about it. I finally decided to record and track how I spent my day.

While I still procrastinate up to this day, I can say that for me personally time tracking has greatly reduced the amount of time I wasted and increased my productivity.

Time tracking probably doesn't sound like the most exciting topic, and for most gives images of time-sheets

The thought of tracking your time probably doesn't sound like the most appealing idea. Images of filling in timesheets, starting and stopping timers sounds very laborious. It all feels like alot of work for not much benefit.  However I would submit to you that tracking my time wasn't as hard as I thought, and has lead to increases in my productivity

# Introduction
As a naturally lazy person, I've always had a problem with procrastination. I would think of grand plans for startups and companies, then revert back to laziness, consuming YouTube and social media.

Keen to snap out of this cycle, I started thinking of ways of boosting my productivity.  Perhaps. 

As a naturally lazy person, I've often wondered about my actual productivity. How much time did I actually spend on work compared to distractions? Were my daily procrastination habits getting out of control? 

This curiosity about my working or procrasination habits led me to create MetaMe, which I now find is an indispensible tool.
