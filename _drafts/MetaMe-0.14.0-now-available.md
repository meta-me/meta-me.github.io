  - Hover + keyboard button press (X) replaces the previous pencil edit button action

    - Hovering over the app then pressing X,C,V,B would categorize as productive, unproductive, neutral and hidden respectively
- Keyboard shortcut Alt + ~ now minimizes MetaMe instead of hiding it.

##### Fixed

- Performance issues which may be causing the dashboard to get stuck loading after long periods of idleness 

##### Removed
