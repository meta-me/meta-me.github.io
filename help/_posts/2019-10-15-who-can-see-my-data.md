The MetaMe application generates two types of data: computer usage data, and telemetry data.

#### Who can see my computer usage data?
Only you can see your computer usage data. Your computer usage data is stored locally on your computer and never leaves. 

#### Who can see my telemetry data?
Telemetry data is sent to our servers to help us improve the MetaMe. Telemetry data will never be shared with other parties.

You can choose turn off telemetry in the settings.
