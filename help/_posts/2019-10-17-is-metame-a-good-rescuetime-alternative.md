title: Is MetaMe a good RescueTime alternative?
section: General
---

We think MetaMe is a great RescueTime alternative. MetaMe was created to address some of RescueTime's shortcomings.

Some of these RescueTime issues include:
1. UI design - We thought RescueTime's had room for improvement. We designed MetaMe's interface to be simpler and cleaner.
2. Slow access to dashboard - We didn't like how RescueTime opened up a webpage when accessing statistics. MetaMe gives you instant access to a live animated dashboard.
3. Privacy concerns - We weren't comfortable with uploading so much sensitive data to RescueTime's servers. MetaMe saves all your usage data into a local database and never leaves your computer. You can be confident that information on your computer activities will not be resold or abused.
